      "Uber from your house to a train line and take the train to the airport.    Will almost certainly be cheaper.    Else go with off airport parking.\n\nI suggest Parking Spot or US Airport parking if you're looking for inexpensive with covered options at USA for hail season. \n\nElse Fine Airport Parking has a great valet with EV charging on site as well, but that doesn't sound like your jam.  \n\nParking *at* DIA is something I'd avoid.    They're trying to address the issues over the last few years, but it's hard to justify with the better security at the off airport lots.",
      "Depends on where you live.\n\n1. The obvious answer is that it's generally safest is to park at home. Get a ride from Friends or Family. Cheapest too!\n\n2. The train to the airport is pretty cheap, and it may be much more cost effective to Uber/bus/ride to Union Station, rather than going all the way to the airport. And you can find covered parking downtown that's cheaper than the airport (though definitely not everywhere).\n\n3. There's a few private airport parking companies that are near the airport and usually cheaper than parking at the airport itself. Park there and take the shuttle to the airport. Better security than the economy lots too.",
      "Fine",
      "Sounds like the biggie is a $50 street sweeping ticket. Can you park at a friend‚Äôs? \n\nSome folks risk RTD lots, I won‚Äôt, in town. (I have out off 285)\n\nThe Fine parking is my partner‚Äôs fave.\n\nI‚Äôll go on Groupon looking for deals.",

Not out of neglect but he was young and busy with school and we did have the means to take care care of, ‚ÄúKimbo‚Äù as we called him. And Kimbo Was young at the time and sometimes he got out of the house. I‚Äôd go chase after him in my neighborhood that I knew better than Kimbo in the beginning. He kept getting out or slipping his collar and became faster and faster each time as he grew. I‚Äôd set up traps and corner him. He‚Äôd run into peoples garages at times even and they came out yelling at me. I shouldn‚Äôt have been In their open garage but I was just trying to get my damn dog. It was a game for him. Eventually he slipped his collar when my mom was walking him once and that was the last time anyone saw Kimbo. \n\nIt sort of has always made me feel bad having a dog who requires much activity and gives me this thought that I should have a dog like this. I live in a 650sqft apartment and would love to have the dog shown in this picture. Or almost any dog. I work a lot. I‚Äôm sure I could get out to dog parks when I can but I do feel bad when thinking about it. But I also guess part of me thinks a 650sqft apartment is better than being in the dog pound awaiting euthanasia if no one ever adopts the dog.\n\nEdit: **Should not have a dog like this**"

      "I went last year and did the same thing (take pictures in certain places).  Didn't see any orbs or strange lights or reflections.  I did it cause it's the Stanley ghost tour ü§∑.  I'm also a skeptic so... Maybe take this with a grain of salt?",
      "I grew up in Estes, and for about 8 years, my mom was the marketing director at the Stanley. I used to run the halls and caves at all times of the day. I also worked there in my 20s as a front desk agent for a few years. \n\nI only had one experience ever. When I was a kid, I was told by a maintenance man that mom was looking for me and was in a room on the fourth floor. This was about 10 pm and I knew we should be going home soon. I ran up the stairs and down the hall to the room she was in. As I was running, I heard heavy footsteps behind me. At first, I thought it was the maintenance man following me trying to stop me from running in the hall so late. When I turned around, there was no one there. When I realized that no one was behind me, I froze in terror. At this point, my mom had heard me and came to yell at me for running down the hall so late at night. When she scolded me quietly from behind, I screamed in pure terror. Needless to say, the 3rd and fourth floor had a lot of sightings and stories when they checked out the next day. üòÜ",
      "Oh wow a topic I can have leget input on. This was probably five years ago. Taking pictures at the top of the stairs, the main stairs, there were orbs. Floating orbs that move at the top of the stairs. This wasnt apart of any tour, a simple set of pictures. Was interesting.",
      "I‚Äôve had friends capture things on camera on the tours, there was definitely something on the photos they took, not just orbs, it was human looking. I‚Äôve never been on the tour, but I‚Äôve been to the Stanley, never upstairs, but there‚Äôs a door in the ‚Äúbasement‚Äù it‚Äôs next to the in house psychic office, it definitely had something to it. I don‚Äôt know what was behind the door, but I know it scared the shit out of me, like I sprinted back up the stairs because it was so strong.",
      "There‚Äôs no such thing as ghosts. Whatever you think happened with the lollipop has a rational explanation. Those tours prey on people‚Äôs ignorance and gullibility",
      "When I worked in Estes Park one summer, I talked to a lady who definitely got a ghost in a photo she took of her son on the staircase. But I didn't notice anything strange on my tour."

      "Probably the cheapest area to buy new construction in and I‚Äôm 100% sure Denver will grown east over the next decade, increasing the property values. Especially with the A line running that way now for easy downtown access",
      "If it's part of the GVR HOA...read up on that. I'm not rabidly against HOAs like some people are, but this one seems particularly predatory, selling homes out from under people due to for example lawns that aren't perfectly cut.",
      "It‚Äôs an area in transition. As far as safe‚Ä¶ relatively. Crime definitely exists, but it isn‚Äôt the worst spot in Denver. It‚Äôs very hard to say how it‚Äôll end up. Some kids think they live in the hood over there and like to act like it. It‚Äôs definitely not the hood. It is somewhat close to Montbello, which probably does qualify as a bad area.\n\nMost people who live in GVR are nice though. There‚Äôs a good amount of basic shopping and services. You‚Äôve got relatively good access to the highways to get into Denver. It‚Äôs close ish to really good food in Aurora. The Arsenal is nice to hang out in if you like hiking. It does lack in nicer amenities but the city is building quite a few parks and encouraging good mixed development. Entertainment is lacking.\n\nWe lived over there for 2 years on 61st:\n\n1. Had my car vandalized (attempted break in)\n2. Rear ended by an aggressive driver\n3. A homeless guy ODed on the sidewalk in front of our apartment\n4. A shooting at the apartment complex down the street\n\nPersonally, there are better areas but it might and probably will turn into a good spot 5-10 years from now.",
      "How far from the Arsenal are you?",
      "I would carefully weigh the pros and cons and see the neighborhood in person well before doing it. I personally know 2 couples who tapped out after just a couple of years (mainly due to the area being somewhat isolated and shitty HOA). Plus, I'd think there's concerns w/ the Arsenal being close by (super Superfund site - read up on if you're unaware), airport noise when closer to DEN, and crime on the peripheries.",
      "Hope you like hail and errant random tornados and/or dust/wind storms. Double up on the house insurance. If you are looking that far east might as well look at Aurora, too. Working from home? Factor into account your commute time as well, wherever you may be headed.",
      "We moved from there closer to Buckley base and the air traffic noise here is 10x worse. Those military jets don't give a fuck. Gvr is not really in a flight path so the sound is not very intense. \n\nI was getting annoyed with all the ATVs and Mini bikes. I got ran off the bike path on a couple occasions. Low level hooliganism in general. Backyard PA system music and fireworks at 2am here and there. But I always felt pretty safe.",
      "North of GVR is High Point, which is where a ton of new construction is going. The GVR King Soopers always has complaints of being under-stocked and a big part of that is how many new homes and apartments have and are being built out there and the KS is older and smaller.\n\n\nThe Walmart off I70 and Tower is shady, with almost everything under lock and key (laundry detergent, face wash, etc.), probably due to the proximity to the highway.\n\nBrighton and Northfield aren't too far away to get to a Target and other restaurants/shops. They're building a Chipotle near 56th and a Cava near GVR Boulevard. The Culver's and the Panera just opened. There was a rumor/plan of a larger than normal Super Target off 56th and Tower, but no idea if that's still happening... That would help with the King Soopers/grocery issue a ton.\n\nThere are good optometrist offices and dental offices nearby, and the Rec center is getting a pool that should open, soon. Traffic will soon increase, as the Pepsi bottling plant is going in off 71st and Tower-ish, as well. \n\nThe airport isn't bad, as planes don't fly super closely most of the time. Spend an hour or two out there to get an idea of the noise level. It's easy to ignore/becomes white noise, at least for me.",
      "Everyone I've known that moved to GVR, moved out after 1-2 years because it's so far out and it's chain hell.",
      "I bought a new build house in GVR a year ago. If you are considering GVR also look at Reunion in commerce city or painted prairie. GVR is safe near as I can tell no issues. It‚Äôs growing like crazy tons of new businesses and amenities. I would recommend the area but I have heard the older part near Piccadilly road might have more challenges. That said Oakwood homes building brand new nice houses across from there. My biggest complaint with the area is the King Soopers is lacking . Lots of great parks around the area. It is a more diverse community but personally I think that‚Äôs a positive."

One is just a straight up like Carnie booth where you throw stuff to win prizes. I saw the lady from the Oriental Massage store just clipping her nails into a trash can. Another store is just like some AI art shit where you can get a poster of Goku wearing a Broncos jersey. \n\nAll around depressing and weird. Feels like it‚Äôs on the verge of imploding completely.",
      "Was just there today and it was packed. The shell of the Forever 21 was for sure sad.",
      "I love that mall!  Too bad about the le Creuset outlet that is a hidden gem",
      "5280 and Gapo Taco both closed as well last week. Owned by the same people apparently but yeah. I talked to one of the waitresses on the last day. She said they didn‚Äôt know they were closing until that morning and the mall refused to help them with things that weren‚Äôt working while getting more expensive, so they left.",
      "This mall is so bizarre and always has been. It's got some weirdness in the random wacky shops, mixed with relatively boring and common big name stores, (Dicks, Burlington Coat Factory, etc), then out of nowhere there's the gems like an official Lego store. \n\nI sold an old Colecovision at the old-school 2nd hand game shop there for $50. I felt pretty good about that. \n\nAlso the tailor near Target is highly recommended. Katalina Chai is pretty good too.",
      "They discussed razing the whole building after the hailstorm instead of repairing it. I don‚Äôt know developer math, but the company I worked for at the time was contracting for some of the repairs and there were heavy conversations around whether or not the repairs were worth it. Time seems to have proven that it probably wasn‚Äôt.",
      "I work at The North Face and our Colorado Mills store is held together by hopes and dreams after it was opened by a store manager who turned out to be the worst ever. He‚Äôs gone now and, as a district, we‚Äôre all picking up the pieces he left. \n\nThe store is a hot mess but give us two weeks and we‚Äôll make it nicer! Can‚Äôt talk about the rest of the mall tho üòÇ",
      "There is a Arhaus (furniture store) opening across from the Forever 21.  A bookstore (of all things) opened about a year ago.  Looks like the two restaurants (5280 burger and a Mexican place) both are closing.  The 5280 burger joint took forever to open.  Bet the landlord is way too proud of their spaces.\n\nForever 21 has been in bankruptcy since 2019 (before the pandemic). Over 150 has or is closing.",

      "Lived through the end days of Cinderella City, and worked a couple shops there in the late 80s. I've seen this movie before. I know how it ends.¬†",
      "I really only ever go to that mall for Target and I suspect I‚Äôm not alone in this. ¬†The way Target is attached to the mall with the the entrance in the back doesn‚Äôt really promote going into the mall. ¬†Either I buy things at Target first and go to the front of the store to pay and then double back to go into the store to go to the mall entrance or I shop in the mall first and I have to go all the way up to the front of Target to grab a cart to start my Target shopping. ¬†The extra steps usually cause me to shrug my shoulders and skip the mall. ¬†\n\nI worked at a Target in a mall in South Dakota when I was in college. The Target was attached to the mall on its side rather than the back like Colorado Mills. ¬†The mall entrance was near the cash registers at the front of the store, making it easier to transition from Target shopping to mall shopping.¬†",
      "There was an amazing local hot sauce store there for awhile but it went out of business. My ex and I used to stop by mills specifically for that store and we were super bummed when it was gone one day. The owner was incredibly friendly",
      "Colorado Mills is more of a mess than we realize. I worked there from 2020, to the holidays in 2023, and holy shit. In the last two years, there‚Äôs been two or three shootings, of which the police have made no arrests, the stores didn‚Äôt close, nothing was done by security, no locked doors, NOTHING. People think the hailstorm and the recovery (or lack thereof) have led to it being more or less a ghost town, but what it really is, is just the denver areas shittiest mall. The people that consistently shop there are cheap, rude, and ugly. News flash, normal sensible people don‚Äôt wanna be around filthy smelly dude that are still sagging their pants and shoplifting at age 45. One of the Chinese massage parlors got busted for human trafficking in 2017-2018. The security guards are just high school kids from McLane, so they are usually starting fights rather than ending them. I could go on and on, but the point is that place just isn‚Äôt safe in the slightest",

      "How much was the half off Dutch oven?",
      "It's actually a very decent mall. Love shopping there. The problem looks like the developers want to raze this mall and build housing. Otherwise they would work with retailers to fix things and see they do not leave.\n\nI won't be surprised if in the next couple of years everything is gone except the target and the restaurants on the periphery, while the mall is razed and housing is built, something akin to Belmar.\n\nRemindMe! 2 years",

      "Hey, I used to live in that complex!\n\nYou're generally out of luck on trying to break lease. That is a relatively high crime area of Aurora, and legally you'd be responsible for researching crime levels in an area you lease in. That you moved in is general acceptance of the risks, crime levels included.\n\nThat said, I currently live in an equally high crime area of Aurora. While things do happen every now and again, you aren't at near as high of a risk as this incident makes you feel.\n\nYou'd be at much more risk in Pueblo.",
      "My car was stolen, someone was murdered, I‚Äôve been followed to my car and threatened by a crazy lady who was pissed I didn‚Äôt hold open the gate for the entire line of people waiting to get in, I‚Äôve had packages stolen, cars get broken into regularly, and there‚Äôs graffiti everywhere. I still can‚Äôt get out of my lease. \n\nHonestly, I‚Äôm kind of glad. I panicked initially, but the truth is that I can‚Äôt afford anything better in the area I need to live in. Moving to a different complex wouldn‚Äôt necessarily prevent these things from happening anyway. That‚Äôs just the nature of living in a major city. I don‚Äôt even live in low-cost/affordable housing or anything. It‚Äôs not particularly high crime or dangerous. Just an older, slightly less expensive neighborhood. I‚Äôm actually planning to stay here one more year to pay off my credit card debt. ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è\n\nThe only laws allowing tenants to break a lease (AFAIK; IANAL) are related to habitability of the apartment itself. Mold, asbestos, lack of heat during winter, no water, no locks, giant holes in the roof/walls, etc. Stuff related to the complex itself isn‚Äôt generally considered. \n\nNow‚Ä¶ if it makes you feel any better, most of these types of murders aren‚Äôt going to put you at risk. Unless gangs are literally doing random drivebys or home invasions in your neighborhood, it‚Äôs probably fine. More than likely, it was a disagreement between two people who knew each other. Possibly drug or alcohol related. It‚Äôs unlikely this type of crime will personally affect you unless you‚Äôre friends with the type of people who have these issues.",

The only change you‚Äôd have would be if you were the shooter and they just evicted you because you were in jail.  Even then they‚Äôd still charge you the full amount of your remaining lease.  Read your lease If there is anything about breaking leases you can find It there.  Your other option maybe to sub lease but you‚Äôll have to find if that‚Äôs allowed in your lease too",

      "No idea. But if the shooter is a tenant, the guv just gave HIM new protections against being asked to leave.",
      "Almost certainly not, but if rents have gone up since you signed your lease they might be willing to work with you. Maybe offer to minimize vacancy by staying until they find a replacement tenant.",
      "Obligatory ‚Äúnot your lawyer/not your property manager‚Äù. This is what I would do:\n\nAsk my doctor to give me a doctor‚Äôs note that says I have to move due to a medical issue, and ask the manager if they can provide me with a reasonable accommodation to break my lease with X notice and without a lease break penalty due to medical necessity under the ADA. And I would ask them to email me the official form. They don‚Äôt technically have to, but they are required to try and negotiate under the ADA, so they would probably just let me go due to the liability. I would also remind them that it‚Äôs peak season and they can re-rent the unit for more than if I stayed, so I would essentially be creating value for the rent roll. Or alternatively, I would try calling the corporate office and asking the Regional Manager if I can leave without penalty if I agree to sign an NDA. Either way, they can only charge rent through the notice period or until a new resident is placed, whichever is sooner. Hope that helps, good luck!"

I haven't made it yet so I don't know what the gender ratio is like, but in my old city there were typically other girls at something like that.\n\nYou will likely also find them at the Ren Faire this summer and at [bookish/fantasy themed events](https://www.instagram.com/reel/C2wPA7JscJi/?igsh=MWQxc294bWRlcjN2eQ==)",

However I wasn‚Äôt going to start looking for a party for about 2 months since I‚Äôm currently getting my masters online and also working full time üòµ‚Äçüí´ But my school workload will start slowing down around then.

I found groups on r/denvergamers and r/lfg (searching Denver inside) that just happen to be mostly women. \n\nThere's a d&amp;d meetup twice a week at Game Train in Littleton,  a weekly meetup at Copper Kettle, Thanes Table in Arvada does drop in games. \n\nYou could also do BumbleBFF and put in D&amp;D as one of your interests.

Then when you have a better idea of neighborhoods, you can do your own search as well.",
      "This is just my opinion, I lived here for three years.\n\nTop Neighborhoods (expensive, but very safe and lots of amenties): Highlands (younger vibes), Cherry Creek (more families), Wash Park (mix of hipsters and families), Platt Park (mostly families)\n\nUpper Mid Neighborhoods (lower price in exchange for higher crime, still lots to do, probably your best bet): Lodo (fratty ballpark area), RiNo (more breweries, gyms, etc), Cheesman Park (more families and shopping), University (self-explanatory), Sloan's Lake/West Colfax (similar areas but Sloan's Lake has slightly higher housing prices and lower crime), South Broadway (fun hipster thrift stores and underground music), City Park (nature, theaters, restaurants, etc.), Edgewater (technically not Denver but close), Speer (sports, performing arts, grocery shopping, etc.).\n\nLower Mid Neighborhoods (lower price, low crime, very little to do): University Hills, Golden Triangle, Belcaro, Auraria (mostly college housing), North/South Park Hill (slightly higher in cost), Englewood (very close to Denver, mostly big box shopping centers)\n\nOnly live here if absolutely necessary (for various reasons): Westwood/Barnum (very few amenities, higher crime, industrial vibes), Regis (middle of nowhere Christian college neighborhood by the highway), Cole/Elyria (next to Purina factory, yuck), Globeville (isolated from rest of city by I-70, few amenties),  Cap Hill (biggest crime zone in the city, but lots to do), Montbello (middle of nowhere, high crime), Baker (higher crime part of South Broadway)\n\nDo Not Recommend: East Colfax (high crime, virtually no amenities, businesses constantly closing because crime is so high they cannot retain employees out of fear of being attacked), Five Points (few amenities, high crime)\n\nAll that being said, apartment quality varies widely between neighborhoods even in good neighborhoods. Read reviews carefully. Different things matter to different people. Also, an ESA is your legal right, no apartment can legally forbid you from having one.\n\nPersonally, I used to live in LoDo and now I live in West Colfax (Luxe at Mile High) and love it. The apartment complex itself is wonderful and management could not be any better. I'd say the crime is medium, there are occasional car break ins but very few violent crimes (my car got broken into more when I lived in LoDo than West Colfax). I enjoy the breweries, parks, restaurants, libraries, and light rail access, just wish there were more \"young people\" things to do like bars, clubs, and music venues. But I also value different things than you might; I'd rather have a little crime than live in a safe but unwalkable suburban parking lot.",

I‚Äôm a teacher at a TINLI school for DPS which means that‚Äôs we naturally get more students who don‚Äôt speak English as we have structures to accommodate for students new to the country. \n\nI‚Äôm not joking every single one of my slides has four different languages written on it to accommodate for English Spanish Vietnamese and French. \n\nJust today I went down to the main office and I saw an outdated roster that said my sixth period has 19 students. That number is now at 36. Of those 36 students, only four is fluent in English. I still remember one day I had a new student and not enough furniture so I had to leave my class to find a supply room with an extra desk and chair while I was supposed to be teaching. I currently have 34 desks so I rely on students being absent or having them use mine as I teach. \n\nThere is no solution. Several months ago I told myself that I just had to make it to summer. I‚Äôm starting to think that this situation won‚Äôt be resolved when the next school year starts in the fall. \n\nIt‚Äôs not perfect but more funding is a good start as there is a shortage of Chromebooks, desks, translators, and anything else you can imagine. \n\nBtw I like my job and think it‚Äôs pretty dope. The newcomers generally end up being my favorite and best students. In one of our staff meetings we found that DPS ran a study and the demographic of students that found the most success were students who tested out of ELD. (Most people probably still call it ESL.)\n\nAgain I like my job but it‚Äôs a shit show lol. I guess I wrote this to show that these students are cool and it‚Äôs honoring that I get to teach students who have gone through so much‚Äîwith or without documentation. And that we‚Äôre overloaded.

    "comments": [
      "It doesn't outlaw parking. It just says you can't dictate a parking minimum. Parking isn't going anywhere. This just allows market economics to better decide how much of it is built.",
      "This bill makes it easier to move into those places that don‚Äôt require as much parking as the minimum. It‚Äôs a virtuous cycle. Excess parking gets repurposed adding to the number of homes and businesses in those locations making them more walkable and accessible. Each spot is 300, SQFT, so 2 can be a 1 BD apartment. Plus you save up to 30k from the construction costs in addition to that opportunity cost. Those extra business may will make the area more walkable further reducing the need for parking. Additional walkability plus less cars will help RTD increase fare revenue and ridership. Adding fund both directly and indirectly through grants, further making car free and car light living possible. \n\nLet‚Äôs remember most households have 2 cars and downtown there is Colorado Carshare for people who only need a car a few times a month. So there is a lot of middle ground for people who looking to drop a car. My family at one point had 4 cars for 4 people because where I grew up you couldn‚Äôt get anywhere without one.",
      "It's a bill to eliminate parking _minimums_, but does not mandate a parking maximum.\n\nWith or without this bill, nothing stops developers from building as much parking as they want to or as much as they feel is financially viable. But the opposite is not true - developers often have to divert project funds that could otherwise provide more residential units, more commercial units, or more office units just to satisfy arbitrary parking requirements - even in cases where the developer and the property owner know it's effectively wasted.\n\nI'd expect a much better balance to come out of this. Less seas of empty parking lots, more housing/commercial/etc. units per building on average, a general increase of density, and a long term increase in walkable areas.",
      "It seems like a good thing to do. It gives more power to each independent business or developer to make their parking lots as big as they want. Allows more area of a commercial lot to be used for retail space or office space instead of parking.\n\nToo much land area is wasted with parking. I see so many parking lots around that are never even half full. Parking in Denver is easy if you're willing to walk 50 feet. Lived here 15 years and never had a problem parking close enough to anything.\n\nAnd remember, this is not a requirement to have less parking. It just allows a developer to do what they want with their land. They can build out as much parking as they want.",
      "I think getting rid of parking minimums is a good thing. I suppose we‚Äôll see how it pans out of course, as with a lot of things what sounds good in theory gets destroyed by capitalism.",

Most stuff isn't a good deal but if you eat a lot of processed stuff (i.e. frozen orange chicken, tv dinners, frozen pizza, etc.) they have good prices on that sort of stuff. They also have good prices on a lot of vegan/vegetarian items.\n\nKing Soopers/Target/Walmart - Of these, walmart is probably the cheapest but if you are willing to coupon any of these can be a cost effective one-stop shop.\n\nAsian/hispanic grocery - usually have good prices on fresh items (produce, meat) but not as good on pantry, frozen, etc. Obv if you are looking for specialty items then these may be the only place you can get them.\n\n  \nIf you are willing to split your trip, you can save on certain items. Otherwise look at what types of food make up most of your budget and maybe see which stores have better prices on those items and shop there for everything. Target can be really cheap between their circle app/ibotta/paper coupons but that can be a lot of extra work and planning.",

      "I‚Äôve found it depends on what I‚Äôm buying. There are some things I only get at Target, some I found cheapest at Whole Foods, some (rarely) at Sprouts. I‚Äôve also had good luck at HMart and the POM. Recently I used Pine Melon and with the specials they had going on the meat and produce was *exceptionally cheap* but I‚Äôm sure that varies based on seasonality and promotions.\n\nETA: sorry yes, it‚Äôs called GW Supermarket now. Out of habit I have just always called it the POM.",
      "Walmart is cheaper for sure.\n\n\nCostco has good prices on staples. For example if your whole family eats oatmeal every day for breakfast, the savings on oats would just about pay for the membership. Flour, rotisserie chicken, breakfast cereal, chips, are some of the best deals assuming you can store and use the bulk amounts. But you have to watch out because there are plenty of bad deals there. If you find things on sale/clearance at regular stores you can get close to or occasionally beat the Costco price.¬†\n\n\nTrader Joe's has good deals on some things, but also lots of bad deals hidden by small portion sizes.¬†\n\n\nAsian grocery stores tend to have good prices.",
      "Surprised no one is talking about Trader Joe‚Äôs. \n\nit certainly is surprisingly cheap. \n\nAs a single person shopping for one, I spend about $80-100 per week, but could cut that down to $50 if times were harder, and have done so occasionally",

If you compare between them and Whole Foods, 80% stuff at WF is actually cheaper. \n\nMy best luck has been a combination of Target and TJs. Target for everything I can‚Äôt get from TJs because honestly it‚Äôs mind blowing how cheap you can get groceries at Trader Joe‚Äôs.

With Tovala's meal plan, there might be minimal \"prep\" - like a literal two minutes putting food into the cooking container (included and recyclable) and maybe putting sauce or sprinkling a packet on top. No cutting, no measuring, no \"real\" prep. And, we re-used the tins until we bought a silicone version of them on Amazon. Perfect runny yolk eggs every time. When I was at my sickest point (cancer with a lot of hospital time), it helped us to be able to still have healthier and easy meals. \n\nTovala is fantastic as a usable appliance and it can air fry, too. It doesn't heat up our place the way a traditonal oven does so we end up using it for a ton of things. And, with the buying meals in lieu of paying more for the stove helped make sure we used it and got used to it. We've had it for almost 3 years. We've stopped and re-started the meal service several times, but we use it daily with or without it.\n\nSuvie is a similar, but different type of oven. I've debated trying it out, too. It's more expensive, but it has two different \"cook zones\" aka separate areas that can have very different settings. It has its own meal service, but is compatible with others. But, I love my Tovala and haven't been able to justify the expense to myself.",

In the 10 years I‚Äôve lived in Denver I can count on one hand the number of times we‚Äôve gotten more than a foot of snow (well below what a roof can handle) and on maybe my fingers and toes the number of times there‚Äôs been snow stick around more than 48 hours.",
      "Hey, I own a roofing company in Denver. Happy to explain. Most flat roofs aren't truly flat, they have a slight run into the gutter. \n\nMost flat roofing membranes are heat-welded at the seams, or they use an incredibly strong adhesive making them water-tight. Additionally, the snow we get here is significantly lighter than Midwest and East Coast snow (originally from NE OH).\n\nIf she has heat tape at the gutter, that will ensure that there isn't a buildup of snow at the edge of her roof which tends to cause problems with the freezing and thawing throughout the winter. \n\nHope that helps!",

One of the biggest ones is that I didn't have a close loving family growing up, and after starting to follow The Grateful Dead, I met so many people there that became my family, made me understand what unconditional love truly is, how to accept others and how to live and let live. \n\nI started following them at 15 years old, and I just turned 54 today, and got calls, emails, and texts from so many of them that I still keep in touch with. \n\nIt always disgusted me how someone like him could make his living and livelihood off of their name. The way he treats others is the 100% opposite of what that community is about. \n\nI hope they put him in gen-pop so he gets a taste of his own medicine.",

My family member almost got killed in the back alley while they were working there one night because some asshole shot someone, and the club shut the doors, and refused to open them for the people (including my family member) who were still outside.\n\nThe new manager has a \"buddy\" that helps him around the club that singlehandedly pushed out almost all the former female bartenders as he has problems with being a sexually assaulting/harassing asshole.\n\nThey push some of the oldest and best DJ's into the worst rooms to try and get them to leave since they're trying to \"revamp\" Milk into a more \"mainstream\" club.\n\nMy family member got fired back in 2021 for speaking up against the current manager and his \"buddy,\" the safety issues, and a multitude of other things.\n\nHope this helps answer anyones questions about why Milk is absolute dogshit nowadays.",

The crowd is boring, often aggressive, not on brand for the night and has been tourists wanting to gawk at the weird kids for years to the extent that those are the main patrons. The cover is insane for the drink prices to also be so high and the last few times I went, I genuinely didn't have a good time and left early. Totentanz at The Crypt is a much more enjoyable night if you're searching out that old school Denver goth night feel. But the scene definitely isn't the same as it used to be which is a shame.

He told me the next morning and he didn't let me out of his sight. He asked me what I remembered because he said I could have easily gotten into someone else's \"taxi\" that night. It was such an awful experience because I've never experienced anything like it. It was one of five times I went out dancing in Denver and my last.",

We didn‚Äôt get hiking in as there was a winter storm that weekend but the trails are there as is ice climbing so probably waterfalls in the spring.

      "Not personally but have helped people get it set up and clients use it. What I‚Äôve heard it is will get you there on time. But is highly variable as to pick up. Like it may be a 15 min drive but they call and say they‚Äôre coming 2 hrs early or it takes a while to get you after the appointment.¬†\n\nI never had someone miss an appointment because of it but had very unhappy kiddos who had to wait for long periods of time in the waiting room before their appointment.¬†",
      "Have you looked into using RTD‚Äòs Access A Ride? They provide door-to-door pretty much anywhere in the Denver Metro area for pretty cheap. They also have this thing called Access on demand. Are they partnered with Uber and Lyft so you don‚Äôt have to wait so long and they pay $25 of your trip",
      "I think it‚Äôs called ‚ÄúIntelliride‚Äù and they contract their rides out to other transportation companies, so it sort of depends on the transport company set up for your ride for the date of your appointment. Sometimes my clients get a call ahead of time to confirm the pick up window and the Intellirides generally follow through. Same for drop offs. Other times, my clients have no idea who is picking them up but you can call Intelliride the day of with the option to inquire about a ride set up that day and make sure someone is getting you. I use it all the time for clients and would say it‚Äôs good 85% of the time. \n\nHope that helps a little.",
      "I'm reliant on these. Sometimes the services will change depending on your provider, and it also depends on where you live.\n\nOn Medicare, I've gone from a great service to a shitty one, to an okay one, to Uber, back to an okay one, to the same shitty one, and finally to using lift, all in the past four years.\n\nGetting there on time wasn't the problem primarily, it was leaving and going back home.\n\nThe worst one; I would need to wait nearly an hour or two for them, after I had called and requested a ride back. Communication was difficult with them too because the dispatcher and all the drivers were Russian and lastly, none of their cars were well kept (bare empty vehicles, metal floors, dirty seats with food and garbage on the ground)",
      "It‚Äôs great! You can submit a request online without even speaking to someone if you don‚Äôt want to be on hold for an hour. You have to schedule the ride at least 48 hours in advance. Very reliable, all my experiences have been good!\n\nhttps://transdevhealthsolutions.com/colorado/",
      "I tried to set it up sometime by asking the people at the Westwood clinic, and they said someone would call me. No one ever called.",
      "I tried them two times and both times had an issue.  The first time, no one picked me up from the appointment so i had to get an uber.  The second time they picked me up late and my appointment got canceled because I wasn't there on time. \n\nDo not recommend."

Took like under 30 mins, been about three weeks I think and they haven‚Äôt buried yet but said once the utilities are marked (happened last week) they‚Äôll send someone out. \n\nSpeed wise I‚Äôve gotten 1.1gbs on a test which was sick to see. However the mesh equipment they give you kind of sucks, I ended up paying for my own equipment and have much better results now. I was seeing massive latency that affected online gaming &amp; the modem isn‚Äôt in a great spot unfortunately (might see if they can relocate it for me) so most devices connect from a pod then to the main router. \n\nThe new ones I picked up had better band support &amp; coverage so I saw much better speeds &amp; latency. \n\nBut yes you can use your own equipment, just plug the ethernet from the modem into your router system.",
      "Quantum Fiber is CenturyLink",
      "I had Quantum fiber installed this past saturday. I got the 500mbps for 50 for life package. Its actually works as adveristed and my down load upload has not gone below 300 yet and seem to be 1:1.\n\nEveryone is going to have a different experience with internet depending on where they live and who they get to install, but Xfinity pissed me off a ton in a three month period and made it super easy to switch from an 80 dollar bill to a faster 50 dollar one",
      "I use both - Q gigabit fiber for my main and Xfinity 300 as a failover.  \n\nYou HAVE to use your own router with Q, they'll give you a modem and what you have is not compatible.  \n\nWhy would it be slower?  940 is technically slower than 1000 but Q is symetrical gigabit and you don't have a contract and also don't have data caps - it also has better uptime and reliability and is cheaper than the gigabit alternative from xfinity.",
      "Most people posting seem to have had a good experience, but I'll post mine. \nWe bought a new build and wanted to get internet set up. We called Century Link and they said we could totally get fiber at our place. But once the tech got to our house, he said the node that connects our neighborhood to the internet wasn't installed yet. After that, CL gave us the run around, saying they were sending a tech out to finish connecting us. But the window as all day, literally 8am to 4pm. After the second time of it hitting 4 and the tech canceling because no one was home (we were home), I went with xfinity. They gave us a two hour window and showed up right at the start of it. We had internet hooked up within 30 minutes.",
      "I made the switch and it was great until Centurylink said it would take a WEEK to get someone out to fix my connectivity issue",
      "Once I learned Quantum was just CenturyLink 2.0... That made the decision for me. Used to have to call Century Link every few months... Haven't had to call Xfinity in years now... No thanks... Centurylink sucked for the first 10 years we lived here... Ill not be switching back... regardless of how much I hate comcast, Centurylink was worse.",
      "I have made the switch and it was night and day.\n\nThe install process for me was great - schedule the appointment, they show up, ask you what place in the house you would like the modem installed, which for us had to be on the wall. Once it was done, we always have 940 up and download speed. If this is an option for you, I would take it. Comcast couldn't come close to matching what Quantum Fiber offers. \n\nThe only hard part was not smiling when I went into a Comcast store to cancel. I decided to do this because I wanted to get a receipt to ensure they didn't try to sneak in any random billing charges.",
      "Network is a lot flatter and more direct to the internet than comcast so things will seems a little snappier. their fiber speeds top out at 1g up/down right now. In my experience, it's pretty stable.\n\nHaving said that, I just got upgraded to comcast's 1.2g/200m plan, and its been really stable for me. I'm looking forward to the next x-class packages later this year that will offer 2g symmetrical with no cap. I pay for the no cap plan right now since we stream everything.",
      "We have quantum 200 plan for $30 and it‚Äôs plenty of bad width for our home.   Speed is fast, 940 isn‚Äôt faster just allows more devices to connect but hard to see how a household would need it.  4k streaming is only 20-25 Mb.",
      "Yep! It‚Äôs great. Fiber is the shit",
      "My current [upload/download statistics](https://imgur.com/a/xNVRVq0) on quantum over the last 30 days:\n\n7.85 TiB (Out)\n1.54 TiB (In)\n\nPeering is also really nice for a residential connection. I‚Äôm never more than a few hops from most other major networks. CenturyLink is a Tier 1 internet service provider so it‚Äôs less likely data goes through transit. \n\nAs a previous xfinity customer it‚Äôs a 10/10\n\nEdit: You are not required to use their supplied router.

      "Centurylink has the worst support on planet earth, but I assume that Comcast is even worse, if you know what I mean. But, we have had zero need for support in 3 years and I assume Quantum is basically the same thing. The internet practically never goes down. I've personally never noticed it down in the time we've had it. I put in a dream machine 3 weeks ago and it shows a perfect 100% uptime since then. I like that with some finagling you can get your PPPoE password and just pitch their modem in the bin and use your own hardware behind the ONT. The symmetrical 1Gbps service I have will hit about 950 sometimes, but day in and day out it hits 850/750, and I'm not really complaining about that, especially not for $60/month.",
      "I switched just a few months ago and I‚Äôm not looking back. Used my own TP Link Deco mesh setup with their optical modem and I‚Äôm getting great speeds with my $50/month 500/500 plan.

      "I switched to CenturyLink from Xfinity a few years ago after moving into a new build. At first, we tried to get Quantum Fiber because we kept receiving the flyers for it, but there was some kind of miscommunication and it turns out we couldn't get Quantum Fiber. So we pivoted to CenturyLink and things were fine at first, speed was comparable and the customer service was friendly and usually responded to our issues quickly. \n\nHowever, in the last few months of me living in that house, our service went out for a couple days at a time once every 6-7 weeks. My friend continued living at this house and the service interruptions continued after I moved out. He switched to Xfinity a little less than a year ago.",

      "When they first dropped there were so many crashes like this that the number of ER visits made the news.\n\nPeople are getting a little better, but they still result in a fair number of crashes as you've found out.\n\nIf you're into them, you can buy personal ones, there are a number of shops around that carry and service them. In Colorado they were re-classified as bicycles along with devices like e-skateboards, e-unicycles, etc. and have all the same legal status as bicycles. Maybe grab a couple lights to wear, a helmet, and whatever other PPE you want. Once you feel better of course!\n\nI do recommend lights you can clip on the back of your helmet and shirt/jacket (or wear a little string sling with lights) so cars can see you in the dark (assuming they're looking of course). The stock lights are so low to the ground that drivers sometimes don't register them visually even if they are looking.\n\n  \nedit: I can't confirm, but Uber/Lyft/etc claim the Denver market is in the top performing markets for their shared device rentals (includes bikes). Not sure if that's true but it's probably pretty close, those things are really popular. Hard to believe we have a bigger market for them than some other cities, but I won't complain if it gets people out and about -- and we're getting better about organizing social expectations for them, too. The first couple years were really rough as a LOT of people just went \"free for all\", but that attitude is starting to shift and hopefully will continue to move in the direction of less recklessness (and fewer wrecks).",

      "Like several people have said, mushrooms are in an awkward spot legally right now. It is legal to grow, consume, and gift them, but illegal to sell. The grey market is also in flux trying to figure out what exactly will be prosecuted or not. There are services that sell a 20 min consultation with a free gift, or something similar like buying an expensive post card with a free gift.\n\nIf you see chocolates explicitly for sale, they could either be fake or the shop is willing to risk it because no one is really being arrested for it right now. Personally, I wouldn't really trust chocolates because you don't know what's in them (could be fake, could be poorly extracted, could be contaminated, etc). But YMMV.",

      "Once the licensing is figured out (end of 24), you'll only be able to buy and consume on premises. There won't be shops selling like marijuana.  It is also not decriminalized but legal to grow and consume psilocybin currently.  You can give it away but not sell.",

      "It‚Äôs been decriminalized now, it‚Äôs just that it now became legalized, which is different than decriminalizing something.\n\nAccording to this article I found it‚Äôs still not happening for most places to sell until late 2024 when the licensing can be given out. \n\nhttps://www.cpr.org/2023/06/21/colorado-psychedelic-law-for-psilocybin-mushrooms/\n\nSo yeah, my guess is, it‚Äôs ‚Äúunder the radar‚Äù (I laugh as I imagine giant sale signs) if you‚Äôre seeing it and unless you believe they‚Äôre reputable I wouldn‚Äôt trust it.\n\nEdit: removed sentence.

We had a few drinks at my friend‚Äôs place and then took an Uber to Federales. I was at a great level of buzz and decided to not drink at Federales because I felt great as I was and didn‚Äôt want to spend money. I started drinking water and talking to some random people at the bar. After a little bit I started feeling super hot and sick. I literally felt like I just took 7 shots of tequila. I went outside in the cold to sober up a little (it always helps) I felt more drunk after I kept drinking water. I thought to myself I drank too much- then I started to chug cups of water and I could barely function. The more water I drank the more ‚Äúdrunk‚Äù I felt. My friends had to call my husband to pick me up from the bar. Right when I got into his truck I immediately puked and started crying. I was spinning and felt hot- I had never in my life felt like this. When we got home my husband had to put me in our tub because I was uncontrollably puking and shaking for hours. I puked about 15 times that whole night until about 10am the next morning. It was horrifying. I couldn‚Äôt  get out of bed or eat or drink anything. I finally got out of bed 24hrs later to use the bathroom. I remember looking in the mirror and around my eyes were swollen and a little red. It was an absolutely horrific experience. \n\nPeople suck.

Made it a good ways down Speer before some very kind person stopped to help me get an Uber home. I put in my parents address (who live in TN) and ended up way out in Lakewood and then screamed and cried and the Uber had to call the dude and I went back to his place in Highland where he stood on the sidewalk with me until another Uber came and I put the right address in. My BF found me outside our door asleep at like 6am because he‚Äôd been out looking for me all night. The ‚Äúfriends‚Äù didn‚Äôt believe me when I told them it happened and I even went to Anschutz and had the forensics nurse confirm the drugging‚Ä¶  \n  \nI was also drugged at Stanley Marketplace on a slow Monday night out with a coworker at like 7pm. I had two drinks and then blacked out for 12 hours straight. Coworker was gonna take the bus home but I guess I insisted on driving them which thank god I did (even though I literally don‚Äôt remember driving) because by the time we got to their place I couldn‚Äôt walk or talk really except to agree with them and they took me inside and texted my BF to come get me.

The bus engine was running, and the sound evolved into a monstrous hellscape. When we started driving, these noises became a spinning vortex all around me. Since I had accidently packed my headphones in my bag underneath the bus, I just had to ride it out for 9 hours in the dark by myself, in my bunk-turned torture chamber. \n\nI'll never forget the sounds I heard.

You have access to both the downstairs and upstairs, so can pick your poison. While there is some seating, your view will mostly be blocked by people on the rails.

As someone who travels every week for work,  smaller/similar sized midwestern cities like Indy, Cincinnati, Columbus, Minneapolis have better Indian, Thai and Chinese food than Denver; most larger cities are significantly better. \n\nAnd given how ubiquitous Indian/Thai/Chinese cuisine is today, it is disappointing that Denver (some Aurora ones are banging) doesnt have better restaurants for it.",

As an example, every meal I had was above average/amazing in all cities I visited this year (eg: Houston, Tampa, Chicago, DC). There are some good/very good places here, but you really have look/know where to find them and/or get lucky (eg:  Just found out the burgers + fries at Punchbowl Social this weekend were pretty good).",

Keep in mind when I was in CA i would split at 70mph w/ the police leading the way, so the 'recommendations' they had there were not universally true but if a cop is ahead w/ no lights you could be free, i have had them wave me back in when i let them pass too, now that was strange.",
      "I have seen behavior along these lines which is dangerous and should result in a ticket. (Not that I expect police to do much of anything these days)  I have also made a point to be on the look out for motorcyclists following the law, both as is and what it will be, and I see that too.\n\nMany motorcyclists often complain about the dangerous behavior of other drivers as it affects them reasonably, to notice bad behavior that is unique to motorcycling is not generalizing. A car isn't going to lane split without an accident no matter what the speed though I have seen passing attempts that make me wonder if many drivers understand physics.\n\nPersonally, I am not surprised with the change in the law, that many people behave stupidly thinking that the change is far more than they think it is. I think many of them will die because of that. I feel for anyone who gets wrapped up in their stupidity. The law as written is fine, but some people will always suck whether they ride a motorcycle or not. This is just a new way to suck in Colorado.",

My experience with them is a bit out of a date, but trying to get care from them at non-DH facility or provider was a huge PITA.\n\nThat said, I think you could probably get amazing medical care there. Their medical staff are excellent (because they see such a wide range of patients) and caring. However, you should also be prepared to be organized and advocate for yourself. It's a big system and it's easy to get lost in it if you're not tracking your own stuff.\n\n If you're relatively young and relatively healthy and live relatively near one of their clinics, it'll be fine.",

So 16th Avenue then would be (today's) 20th Avenue.\n\nBut when Ordinance 50 was passed, it defined the North/South numbering scheme to align with the downtown numbering scheme, e.g. 17th Ave would be the road running east from 17th St at Broadway. The streets counted down from there southwards until Ellsworth then became the 0th street.\n\nIf you're interested in more, I'd highly recommend the book Denver Streets by Phil Goodstein.",

They aren't something you just 'get' and then get rid of as your life situation changes, that's just cruel and will only cause or aggravate separation anxiety as well."

      "Depends on the variety of grass seed but for cool season grasses, overseed in March/April is the norm. \n\nPersonally, I'm not a fan of dethatching. It's better to top dress compost &amp; work it in to promote microbial activity to break down the thatch. But if the thatch layer is too built up, might need to do it. You would be fine doing hand dethatching now or after the seed is established. Power raking do before over seeding and go ahead &amp; aerate while you are at it.\n\nIdeal would be light hand dethatch (use small/medium metal leaf rake), mow if needed, then aerate &amp; overseed, top dress compost &amp; work in.\n\nFor grasses, I'd recommend a Texas blue grass hybrid. It's typically crossed with a fescue type iirc. Extremely drought tolerant, low water needs, very deep rooting, spreads by both stolons &amp; rhizomes so heals quickly. Holds up really well to foot traffic, full sun &amp; pets. Most varieties also slow their growth once temps hit 90s, so less mowing üòÅ\n\nUnless your sprinkler system is self draining or frost resistant, wait to activate them until next month &amp; do manual watering.\n\nEdit: spelling",

      "Too soon to seed or turn sprinklers on. We‚Äôll usually get one more cold snap/snow. Wait till Mother‚Äôs Day. \n\nHand water/hose sprinkler if you have to.\n\nEDIT: What I meant was, if you put down seed and it starts germinating now and starts growing, then we get snow, it‚Äôll most likely kill the new seedlings is what I understand. Seed that hasn‚Äôt sprouted (e. g. dormant seeding) is fine but new little baby grass might not make it through if we get snow.",

      "I used a swamp cooler in a south facing second floor room in a brick house. It kept that room cool. But one thing regarding those is buy slightly larger than the square footage rating, particularly if you're susceptible to heat. I doubt one will cover roughly 1,000 square feet considering walls, which will impede airflow somewhat. If your bedroom is 200 sq. ft., for instance, consider getting one rated for at least 300-400 sq. ft.",
      "&gt;Would using a swamp cooler actually be feasible?\n\nLargely no.  The most cooling you can get from a swamp cooler is about 20 degrees, at most.  If the humidity outside sky rockets - you'll only be able to cool off 5 degrees (or less).  We have a massive one on our roof and it works alright.  I'd prefer to have air conditioning if I was building the house from scratch.\n\n&gt;For reference I live in an apartment complex so nothing involving reno. Our apartment is &lt;1000 sq ft., not sure exact square footage.\n\nMy experience with any sort of portable system is that they suck.  Portable swamp coolers do exist - but if I had a medical condition that requires me being cool - I would not trust it to work all the time.  Maybe reframe it mentally as - \"Running the AC is cheaper than an ER bill\".\n\nPerhaps look into something like an Eight Sleep Cooling system?  That will be able to cool over your bed without requiring you to run the AC at max.",

On a 90 degree day its great, keeps the house humidified and everyone is happy. \n  \nOnce it gets above 90 though, things start to slip.

It seems to me that you are crossing your wires - you‚Äôre thinking about the DMV in terms of credentials and identification but in the realm of vehicles, the rules are different and much more relaxed. \n\nHow you do it is: you purchase the vehicle in the other state, register it there, get inspection there.

      "We are sick of paying $17 for a burger with no F**king fries.",
      "Sounds like (hopefully!) the market is just correcting itself and restaurant prices need to be adjusted. Colorado was the number one state in the country in restaurant price inflation over the last few years so it would make sense that people have responded by not eating out as much.",
      "Between food and service quality declining, prices skyrocketing, mandatory fees being added, and tipping pressure on every single thing‚Ä¶ eating out just isn‚Äôt what it used to be.",
      "I agree with everyone on the quality and price point issue. The prices here have risen and incomes have not. $17 plus tip for a hamburger and $8 for a beer is coastal city prices. And im not making that kind of income.\n\nThat said, at the same time Im getting older and eating low quality fried and fatty food in noisy environments seems less attractive. These days I prioritize quality over quantity, price over ambiance, and health over convenience. I want to know exactly where my food is coming from, how much salt and oil I put in it, and be able to shop for lower prices and not have to pay 20% tip.",
      "Mediocre food, poor service, and high prices; what's not to like?",
      "$17 for a hamburger when I can get all the ingredients and have 6 of the same for that price is the reason.",
      "Absolutely sick of getting hosed for every single fucking thing. Can‚Äôt go out to have drinks and a meal for under $100. Then prompted 20% tipping to walk up to a counter and order my food, like fuck you. I worked fine dining for a decade and the tip was because you WAITED on the table. You knew the menu backwards and forwards, made recommendations, you paired wines with meals, you kept water glasses full, you coursed meals and did all that and more with a personality - that was a 20% tip. Now it‚Äôs typically this: I walk up to order at the counter, I serve myself drinks, fill my own water glass and occasionally bus my own tables, plus deal with low wattage/unhappy imbeciles for $100 meal and then you flip the iPad around and I‚Äôm expected to tip 20% too? Or it‚Äôs automatically added to my tab? I‚Äôm so burnt out with over priced, low caliber food, subpar service, and sky high tipping.",
      "I go to a brewery and a burger is $20 before tip. You add a beer or 2 and that‚Äôs a $50 meal for one. No thanks I‚Äôll make burgers at home and buy cans of beer.",
      "I own a local business so I very much understand why prices have increased and as a customer I‚Äôm willing to pay for good food and service but my main issue is the quality has gone down hill at a lot of places. It‚Äôs just not worth the cost as a customer a lot of the time.",
      "They are for the upper class now along with McDonald‚Äôs",
      "Honestly, the out of control tipping culture combined with the inflationary impacts of higher cost to begin with have really turned us off of eating out except for special occasions.  I mean when I‚Äôm handed a card reader with an expected 30% tip on top of a $50 mediocre meal then I‚Äôm not very motivated to come back anytime soon.",
      "I‚Äôm cooking at home. Way cheaper.",
      "IMO the restaurant industry right now is a proper example right now of the stock market phrase ‚Äúbulls make money, bears make money, pigs get slaughtered‚Äù. Cheaper mom and pop shops are gonna be okay and high-end restaurants that are expensive, but have good quality and service, are gonna do fine as well. It‚Äôs the people trying to charge near $20/head for some meh food and shit service that are hurting right now.",
      "Sushi chef here at a place in lohi. I feel like your average place where the food haven‚Äôt changed or improved much but the price has gone up a lot isn‚Äôt getting the traffic normally, but good places that actually put work and thought in their food are still doing good. \n\nOne of my chef friend at Lucina(amazing fine mexican dinning) told me they just had one of their busiest month in sales in years. And the sushi place I work at is actually doing 10-15% more comparing to 2023. My roommate who works at rioja says they are doing well too. \n\nPeople are still willing to pay for good food, good drinks and good services but it‚Äôs gotta be actually good.",
      "Scene is rough at all price points relative to higher cost cities I‚Äôve lived in. Was just in NYC for work and things were cheaper there (whether it was a coffee and breakfast sandwich or a nice dinner) which is insane. \n\nI don‚Äôt think I‚Äôve had an expensive meal here I thought was worth it - if Linger and Tavernetta are the best we can do, then the scene is bad. Would‚Äôve rather cooked for myself after those places, and I‚Äôm a bad cook.\n\nAt the higher end, I wonder if it‚Äôs because there isn‚Äôt much of a cocktail scene here and the alcohol margins are how east coast restaurants make it work. \n\nThere are a few neighborhood joints i love on the west side but that‚Äôs about it.",
      "Tipping culture, bad service, the quality of food has gotten lazy. It's cheaper to cook at home now that inflation is getting worse.",
      "Price for quality doesn‚Äôt align‚Ä¶‚Äùtrendy‚Äù decor gives the illusion of quality, but the food is average. Even high end places like Guard and Grace, Bruto, etc. don‚Äôt deliver for what they‚Äôre charging. The food isn‚Äôt bad, but it doesn‚Äôt command the prices they‚Äôre charging like places in LA and NY.",
      "Can't eat out everyday when rent is $2000 for a 1bdrm",
      "I've worked in the restaurant industry since 2012. Last year, I decided to go back to school because I could tell things were getting bad and I needed to do something else with my life. The bar I was working at closed down last month due to bankruptcy and the restaurant I was working at prior to that is also on the verge of being shut down.\n\nI actually did a research paper this semester on the effects that the COVID-19 pandemic had on the restaurant industry, specifically server incomes. But I also explored the rising costs of business operations as well as the rise in delivery apps and ghost kitchens. Prior to the pandemic, restaurant sales were actually expected to rise dramatically. The pandemic stopped everything in it's place and nothing has been the same since. Part of this of course is the cost of eating out. For as expensive as groceries are, it is still much, much cheaper to eat at home. And on the topic of delivery services, UberEats and the likes charge such insanely high fees to restaurant that if you aren't a corporate brand, you most likely can't afford it. People around here looooove their UberEats, but the only restaurants you see anymore are chain brands or places that cater specifically to carry-out (like pizza shops and Chinese take-out). So smaller restaurants aren't getting any business in that regards. Smaller, family-owned places are dying, and it's so sad.\n\n I don't have all my research on hand right now, but I can definitely share some of it if anyone is interested.",
      "I just moved to Denver and have absolutely no right to respond, so here we go. \n\nI feel like the food scene is kinda mid here. The price to food quality math just ain't mathing. The price is either really high or the food quality is lower than expected. Haven't found much in between.",
      "I'm tired of the mandatory tipping culture.  Just put it in the price and pay your employees like every other fucking business model on earth.\n\nThere's nothing worse than paying premium prices for a sit-down meal with mediocre to poor service and then feeling pressured to make a charitable contribution on top of that.",
      "I hope so. $20 for a burger, $1 for a piece of lettuce, $3 for a bun, $1 for a pickle chip, $2 for cheese, $2 for mustard, 15% for kitchen staff, 20% gratuity added. \n\nSuggested tip: 22%, 28%, 34%\n\nThen the burger comes out dry, the ingredients are soggy, and you can see where they cut the mold off the bun. And you have to grab your own food from the counter. \n\nThe ‚Äúserver‚Äù comes by once to ask if your food is okay but leaves before you can even look up.",
      "I think it has a lot to do with rapid rise in costs for everything here, but wages haven‚Äôt scaled to accommodate Denver now being a HCOL area. Others are commenting that we have LA and NYC prices for eating out, but if you live in those places, for an equivalent job you could have here, you get paid 20-30% more. \n\nAlso, in places like NYC, I think there is a higher portion of the population that have high earning jobs and many people move there for the city culture (which includes eating out), while most people move to Denver for the outdoors, not the city itself.",
      "The current Denver food scene isn‚Äôt worth the poor service and higher prices. A lot of the well known places are really trash in disguise as a solid yelp review.",
      "The other day I was ordering a beef burrito, it was $9, then +$3 for guac, +$2.50 to get it smothered, then +$7 for pork. \n\nThen if you want a side of rice and beans +$4.50.\n\nIt's kind of crazy how adding any flavor that used to be standard on most dishes makes a burrito cost more than a steak dinner. \n\nAnd a beer is $12\n\nI love going out, but now I love eating on my couch.",
      "I can make just as good, if not better, food at home for a fraction of the price.\n\nEven if we go out, we order and pick it up so we can eat at home to avoid the bad service trend.",
      "Bag of wilty salad greens with a sprinkle of parmesan - $17\nAdd protein - another $8 for 3oz of dry chicken\nRandom \"kitchen fee\" - $5\nEntitled waiter who did nothing but carry a plate to your table and gave no shots about if the food was good holding a tablet with 30% tip automatically selected\n\n\nGee I wonder why",
      "About a week and a half back, on Wednesday afternoon, I got some really big work news. Boyfriend wanted to take me out to celebrate. Over my lunch break, we talked about a couple of options but neither of us was super hungry so figured we'd decide once I'm off work. Work day ends at 6:00, probably pull out of the parking lot around 6:10 and with a 20 minute commute, I'm in the door just after 6:30. At home, we start pulling up options and we're immediately crestfallen. Realize just about everything is closing in the next 90 minutes. 8pm seems insanely early for a dinner establishment to close, especially as people who dont usually eat til 7:00/7:30. Sure, if we'd have rushed out the door that second, we could have probably enjoyed ourselves well enough but as people who've both worked in food service ourselves, neither of us like being the kinda folks getting booted out at closing. Plus this is meant to be a nice celebratory meal. We'd wanted to have a few drinks and enjoy desert maybe, not just sit, eat and run.¬†\n\n\nEnded up having mac and cheese that night and going out a few days later when I had the day off. Would be nice if restaurants other than fast food places gave a shit about more than just their customers who work 9-5s.¬†",
      "Don't mistake change for death. About 30% of restaurants don't survive the first year. By year 5, 80% will close. What you're seeing is normal for a larger city IMO. \n\nDenver has seen a lot of growth in recent years. I'm from Chicago and I've watched one particular restaurant in a fantastic corner location get turned over, like clockwork, every 3 years for the last 15. Closed for renovations, re-opened as a newish concept. Same owners. Same location. They rebrand it just to get customers back in the door. The location great but they have a lot of competition. It's run by a company called One Hospitality. They are incredibly successful and own strings of restaurants that most people don't realize are related, but they are very canny restauranteurs. I think a lot of owners run their dream into the ground when they should pro-actively close when things start to dip and they still have the money to reconcept and re-open.\n\nThere will always be those few restaurants that become neighborhood stalwarts and live forever but that's about 20% of ventures.  \n\nDon't forget that gentrification and demographics mean the people in a restaurant's neighborhood are constantly changing. The restaurant needs to change too. It's a different game somewhere like 16th Street which is tourist focused, but that's not the majority of restaurants.",
      "I‚Äôve been cooking more at home personally. I went out to breakfast at a joint where the cups were dirty (lipstick still on the glasses), food still stuck to the plates and forks, and the food smelled rancid. For all that, my family was asked to pay $60 plus a 20-25% tip. This is kind of the extreme end of things, but overall most places have been less and less of a treat between quality, cleanliness and service. There are a few I still will routinely visit because it‚Äôs still a good value overall. They‚Äôre still kind of expensive, but worth the price.  I wish more restaurants were on their A game, I‚Äôd gladly pay for that. \nGroceries are expensive but overall I know I‚Äôll get what I want at home and to my taste, likely for less. \nIt really makes me sad for restaurants and their owners - two near me have recently closed after very long runs. One stopped paying their taxes, I guess that can‚Äôt be helped in contributing to the shut down of their business. The other I actually liked and frequented the past six years, but in the past six months stopped because it was increasingly filthy.",
      "It used to be kind of expensive but worth it to go out and grab a burger and a few beers, not have to cook or clean up afterwards. Now it‚Äôs 20 dollars for a normal sized regular old cheeseburger that‚Äôs nothing special. I can buy 8 patties and buns and just make it at home on the grill for that price. And for the price a lot of places are charging for beers anymore I can just buy a six pack. I can‚Äôt remember where I was last month that wanted 12 dollars for a tall Modelo.",
      "I just google mapped random restaurants in Denver and looked at their menus. A chicken breast dish with some sort of cheap green vegetable side is averaging $36. So after all of the complimentary fees, taxes, and tip, a chicken breast comes out to $50. Why would anyone pay $50 for a $4 dish in a world where all other prices are also gouged and wages aren‚Äôt keeping up with it?",
      "It's exciting to eat out, but more often than not I'm disappointed and left wishing that I would've stayed home and cooked my own food. Prices are too high, tipping percentage continues to increase, added fees, and food quality isn't even there for it all to be justified. \n\nSo many restaurants place a premium on aesthetics and decor, but what's the point if the food is subpar or average at best.",
      "I slowed down eating out for COVID and have pretty stopped since. The last time I went out to get some pho I was shocked that they were charging $15 for a medium bowl! Used to love going get a cheap bowl once or twice a week with my wife, but now I have to reaaally be in the mood to pay 45$ for 2 bowls of pho and some egg rolls.",
      "I intentionally go to businesses without added fees. It‚Äôs funny bc I feel like these businesses think we won‚Äôt notice, but I do and then I make another choice.",

But the dog poop issue has become a huge problem‚Ä¶ you can walk down any populated part of Denver and see people either just not picking it up, or leaving their poop baggies everywhere. I used to live in Cap Hill and I started to call it ‚ÄúCRAP-itol Hill‚Äù because every single week, while getting into my car in the morning, I would step in a pile of dog shit.

      "Alot of places have a house NA now.  It would be best to just bring up the tap list and look.\n\nDo just one or two breweries that are close to each other and break it up with a meal in between.  The energy at breweries and bars is frankly kind of lame if you aren't drinking.  After one NA or so most people will be over it and ready to move on.  Breweries seem much more fun when you are getting the dopamine hit off the alcohol.",

      "Most places at least carry Athletic Brewing. I highly recommend New Terrain, just this side of Golden. Great vibes and a beautiful outdoor space. \n\nBe aware that even N.A. beer typically has .5% or less alcohol in it, so if it‚Äôs an allergy that could still be enough to cause issues.",

I asked, there‚Äôs nothing stronger you can prescribe? She looked at me like I was a junkie and refused. My IUD ended up causing so much sharp pain and I spotted heavily for a couple weeks. They told me to call if I bled or was in pain, and when I did they literally *chuckled* and said, well if it‚Äôs as bad as you say then just go to the ER I guess. On my ultrasound follow up my IUD looked crooked and they were like, it‚Äôll fall into place. My next gyno appt a year later it was literally almost falling out.

Many were judgy/dismissive when I requested more than ibuprofen. I had to advocate for myself until I found someone who would give me what I needed to get through the procedure. Worth it!",

On a busier night, (many delayed flights landing at once) I was met with chaos and many arguments down that taxi line. Ubers were just insane going over $150 estimates and the taxis were negotiating hard to get 2-4 DIFFERENT travelers into their van, still trying to charge the full prices of 80-100$ without discounting the fact that they had made it a taxi-carpool. I‚Äôve had one good experience with them and it was fine , negotiated set price was only slightly more expensive than uber which was backed up at the time . I think the rule is try to get uber/lyft but if not just negotiate a fair set price with these Wild West ‚Äútaxi‚Äù drivers‚Ä¶ in their old vans that never turn on a real ‚Äúmeter.‚Äù",

On this night the last train will go over it at about 210 am. Where as normally the first train would go over at about 320 am so its a tough choice of when to pull service. Another thing the reason why Central park and not Peoria is the way the signal system is set up. It creates much less confusion for people as the tracks would switch back and forth for the train going to Union. Central park has a cross over just east of the station allowing trains to arrive and depart from the correct track. All in all if going to the airport I‚Äôd recommend finding alternative transport the last time something like this happen it generally adds like 40 minutes to the ride from central park.",

So for the upper right-ish quadrant (this is probably more like 20% and not 25% of the city) you have 2500 intersections. Times that by 4 and you get 10000 intersections. And roughly 10000 manholes. Double that maybe if there is one per side of the block? And triple that if it‚Äôs counting storm drain covers too. Would be interesting to know for sure the answer.

      "I have no answers, but I‚Äôm interested in seeing the replies. My neighborhood has lots of these properties, but the numbers never made sense to me either. They seem too expensive for the people who qualify. The only people I know personally that bought through the program don‚Äôt have W2 jobs (cab/Uber drivers), so I assume this works best for people who can manipulate their income on paper.¬†",
      "Sounds like it would be easier for someone to qualify if there wasn‚Äôt a $545/month HOA fee. Seems like the program might not have considered what HOA fees might do. Seems like you‚Äôre in a bit of a pickle trying to sell, I‚Äôm sorry.",
      "It's basically for people who can figure out some way to scam the system. For example, get a higher paying job to save money for the down-payment or inherit money, then a lower-paying job to qualify, then switch back to a higher paying job once the contract is signed to be able to afford it. Everyone I know who took advantage of these programs had some way to manipulate their income on paper while actually having a different income. I don't blame them for doing that because the requirements are set up to be impossible, but it kind of defeats the point of having these programs.",
      "Are you saying HOA dues or Condo dues? Does it include utilities or just ground maintenance and snow removal?\n\nAlso, I‚Äôm a lender that just moved here from the east coast. I‚Äôve never heard of an ‚Äúaffordable housing ownership program‚Äù requiring 20% down. Was that a requirement or only being put down to qualify? That‚Äôs regular conventional financing with no MI. \n\nThis does NOT seem like a good deal‚Ä¶",
      "I‚Äôm curious where you‚Äôre seeing the requirement that it be 35% of take home pay.¬†\n\nI know that the city has a number of different affordability covenants, which all have different requirements (and problems) but typically the cap would be 35% of gross income.¬†\n\n[See here](https://www.denvergov.org/Government/Agencies-Departments-Offices/Agencies-Departments-Offices-Directory/Department-of-Housing-Stability/Resident-Resources/Affordable-Home-Ownership)\n\n‚ÄúThe monthly housing payment expense must be more than 35% (FEHR) of the household‚Äôs total income.‚Äù\n\nUsing your example above monthly gross pay at an $89K salary is $7,416. Multiply that by 35% and you have a max housing payment of $2,595, which is more than the mortgage + HOA of $2,150 in your example.\n\nIf your covenant specifically says 35% of take home pay, that‚Äôs definitely a problem! And probably one I‚Äôd elevate to city staff or yoir council person.",
      "I am under this program and it made complete sense when I purchased in 2020. If you can save up for the down payment, it is way better than paying the apartment prices, which are typically more. Only thing you would worry about is if something breaks. BUT, I am also a super low interest rates.",
      "1. I think HOA fees are outrageous for some townhomes. For a first time buyer looking for a sub 400k home to build equity that at least holds me back on those properties.\n2. It sucks making too much money to qualify for any affordable housing program (80-90k). But on the other side it seems impossible to try to save an and buy a house.",
      "I tried to get one of these homes and ultimately couldn't. My income was within the limit, but I would have needed a way bigger down payment for the numbers to line up correctly.",
      "I qualified only $500 over the bare minimum to get a 1 bedroom condo and it was the best decision I've ever made in Denver. The condo was actually affordable and was the cheapest property sold in Denver since 2021. My neighbors are all pretty chill and most are really grateful to move on from Denver slumlords. It's a great program and it fills up easily even though a lot of people on reddit might not qualify. The real problem is that they'll probably never build sub 200k condos again.",
      "I work in the affordable housing market.\n\nThe current interest rate is a real killer. Though we offer lower than current, we still have to offer a decent interest rate.\n\nWhy? We sell our affordable mortgages to CHFA and other banks to then use that capital to purchase more property to build more affordable homes.\n\nCHFA and banks REQUIRE a certain interest rate to make purchasing the mortgage worth it over the life of the mortgage.\n\nWe also receive government (city, state and fed) grants to help subsidize these homes (selling a $500k home for only $350k) and they require that 35% of monthly income. So even though a homeowner is will to pay 38% we can‚Äôt sell it to them at the affordable rate.",
      "I was able to snag a townhouse in the HOST program last year but it wasn‚Äôt easy. While my income qualified, rising interest rates meant that I was getting priced out of the program and I could only afford one of the cheaper units (mine was built in 2008/2009). Also, each townhouse that went on the market would receive 20-30 offers that were almost exactly the same so it took a year and a half for me to have an offer get accepted. I can‚Äôt remember how many offers I submitted but it felt like a lot. Sellers would find sketchy ways to get around the resale price that the city would set for them by excluding certain items from the sale like the fridge or washer/dryer and asking extra money for that. I lost out on one townhouse where the winning bid offered $25k for the seller‚Äôs hideous furniture. Also, the city was letting Elevation Community Land Trust pilfer homes from the HOST program, making them less affordable in the process, and I lost out on several homes because of that. ECLT was making all cash offers that pretty no one can compete with. I complained to the city about that but I‚Äôm not sure if they‚Äôre still letting ECLT buy homes from the program.¬†"

If you can play GC and oversee trade you can probably get to $50/sqft.",

A good idea of tile budget should be about $5-6/sqft for material and about the same $5-6/sqft for labor. You can find tile for cheaper, but keep in mind you'll still need thinset (1 bag will get you 40sqft), caulk, and transition strips, waterproofing agent, mesh tape for the corners. \n\nAs far as flooring for the rest, id budget about 2-3sqft for material, and about about $2.50sqft for labor (if you go the LVT route)",

Maybe the laundry area is completely done and being used, just in an unfinished basement?\n\n$30k will barely get it done doing all the work yourself with minimal finishes. \n\nYou are looking at about $70-100k depending on finishes and quality of contractor.",

Since you were remote, that'll probably be CO, but could be TX. When you go to file online it'll tell you if you have wages here.\n\nPrepare for 6-8 weeks processing time. You'll want to request payment while your claim is pending so you can be back paid, but it will likely take up to 8 weeks.\n\nYou can quit or be discharged and still get UI in CO, but it depends on the circumstances. In your situation, it's not really going to matter what your employer labels the separation as. A real person is going to review your case and the substantive facts on file are going to be their main focus not just \"quit vs fired\".\n\nYou'll want to wait all the way up until you truly can't work there anymore to separate from employment. They'll likely say you quit by refusing to transfer which is fine. You want to work until the end so there's no question that the demand to transfer was the cause of your separation.\n\nWhen you complete your UI paperwork, you'll want to explain what you've said above about always working remotely and the request to transfer to TX being unreasonable. \n\nYou could be allowed due to a \"substantial change in working conditions\" that was also less favorable to you. So those are the big points you'll want to prove when you complete your application.\n\nWatch out for follow-up contacts from the UI office because your processor will only make one attempt to reach you and you'll be SOL if you miss their deadline to respond. That contact could be around that 6-8 week mark so keep checking in.\n\nAssuming you made $65k or more in the last year and a half, you'd be looking at $781/week in benefits pre-tax. Even if you are denied, it's always worth appealing which has its own separate process.\n\nAnd if they have you sign an agreement for severance, take it! CO won't penalize you for it. Even if they pay you severance, they can't stop you from also drawing UI.\n\nBest of luck!",

      "OK, so the conference is taking place in Estes Park. That's ~120 km from Denver International Airport, so you will need to comb the web for transportation to/from Estes Park and the airport. I would suggest checking with other attendees to see if someone has chartered a van or bus from the airport that might work for you. The only public transit I'm aware of that goes between Denver and Estes Park is the Bustang, but it's seasonal and probably won't start running until the end of May. And a glance at commercial shuttles from Denver International Airport shows a round trip to Estes Park is US $135. Keep in mind that Estes Park from Denver is like going from Dublin Airport to somewhere like Cavan‚Äîexcept Cavan is nearly twice the population of Estes Park and Colorado hasn't any serious public transport.  \n  \nEstes Park is a tourist town and the gateway to Rocky Mountain National Park, one of the most-visited national parks on the planet (not quite Yellowstone, but almost as heavily visited). So that means not many places in town will be available for cheap lodging: the tourist industry tends to either regulate those out or make them expensive. You might see if the local YMCA has lodging available since the one in Estes Park is pretty good and probably offers some kind of shuttle service into town (it's 8-9 km from the YMCA to the venue). The nearest university is nearly 70 km away and again, no public transit. Estes Park is truly \"in\" the mountains and is a small town, and if memory serves, they don't even have free, local shuttle buses like many tourist towns.  \n  \nCamping might be an option since there are local campgrounds in and around town, for which there is a fee. Those campgrounds are oriented toward caravans and the like‚Äînot tent sleeping‚Äîbut are still serviceable. But here's the warning: Estes park is 2300 m above sea level and that means May will still have wintry weather now and then. As in, be prepared for snow and temperatures that could reach -10 C at night. Personally, I've scraped frost off my tent in Estes Park in mid June, meaning the overnight was below zero C‚Äînothing like getting frozen hands trying to pack a tent fly that's still got ice in it!",
      "So I looked up this years conference, it appears to be in Estes Park?\n\nIf so, that is an hour and a half drive from Denver on a good day. Three hours round trip.

I'll DM you if that's a possibility.\n\nIn the summer I think there's (usually) a Bustang service (basically just a regional bus) to Estes/Rocky that might be handy for you.",
      "If the conference is in Estes park, you‚Äôre much better off trying to crash with some college or grad students in Boulder than in Denver. It‚Äôs about half the distance! Transportation will still be tough, but there may be Boulder students going as well that you could carpool with.",

Please don't use the pre made food with artificial dyes, simple 1 part sugar to 4 parts water mix is all you need. Clean the feeder and replace the mix every 2-3 days, and more frequently in the summer when it's hot. Sugar water ferments in the heat, making it toxic and you could easily kill them.",

Feeding hummingbirds can change their migration patterns. They can and do rely on non-native food sources. If you are going to feed hummingbirds, which personally I think is great, you should ask yourself, are you willing to make sure you're feeding them with the right food, using the right style of feeder, that you're regularly cleaning the feeders out and replenishing them, and are you going to do this year in and year out in a consistent manner? IMO most people are not looking for another maintenance item to do every couple weeks, but maybe you're ready to take this on long term.

They are around, just not in clouds like they are in Castle Rock, Golden, mountains, etc.\n\nMigration we tend to see more species, though.

Tower road could just be blocked off to vehicular traffic, but all the existing businesses on the road would still be accessible to cars by using the two streets that run parallel to Tower Rd.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTry driving down those two roads you will see they are both inadequate for the current traffic.   Yampa street has barely visible lines and full of potholes.  Not to mention it would be diverting flow on a route to the airport.  \n\nAs someone who drives that stretch on a regular basis, it would be cumbersome.  But honestly, not sure it would even work due to the businesses in the area.  It is mostly serviced by hotels for airlines / quick layovers.  And the traffic is from the local residents / hotels / airport parking lots.",

We live literally a couple blocks east of this and can‚Äôt wait to get out of this area. \n\nThere‚Äôs actually a decent amount of foot traffic on Tower but it‚Äôs usually just south of where you‚Äôre talking about here. It‚Äôs definitely going to grow with how much construction is going on, though. \n\nWhat you‚Äôre NOT seeing is how many people panhandle in this area. It‚Äôs been cleaned up a lot recently but around the holidays there were literally people at every intersection. They‚Äôre still at King Soopers and Sprouts constantly waiting outside with their baby strollers and kids playing on iPads. \n\nNot saying it‚Äôs a lost cause to try and beautify this little area, but it‚Äôs already setting itself up to be kinda bleh. There‚Äôs also ANOTHER gas station being built right in that area as well. So I‚Äôm sure that‚Äôll add to the mess.",

      "There's a reason people don't do foot or cycling traffic in this area, and it's not because of there being a lack of ability to do so.....",
      "Neat concept but I'm unsure if your design allows vehicles to cross Tower Road, similar to Pearl St. in Boulder. If not, I think that flexibility would need to be built in. Similarly, it looks like you have 61st blocked off. A lot of people who don't live near an A-Line station (myself included) rely on 61st to access the park-and-ride to get to the airport. I would keep 61st between Salida and Richfield open to cars, so folks can still transition to the parking lot from 60th (unless Panasonic Way could somehow be extended and cars could cross 61st that way).",
      "I like the idea but not the location.  Would be interested in seeing Denver try this in other denser locations first.  \n\nHaving traveled to many European cities - it's a night and day difference experiencing pedestrianized cities versus car heavy cities.

      "Tower is a classic stroad. With most stroads, you generally have two options.\n\nThe first option is to turn it into a full on road. A road should have limited access with almost no driveways. There's plenty of right of way here for a boulevard concept in which you have a road down the center and parallel streets with access to businesses. Those parallel streets should be made to be usable by bicyclists and pedestrians. Something akin to the Dutch service streets: https://bicycledutch.wordpress.com/2012/05/21/dutch-service-streets-and-cycling/\n\nThe other option is to turn it into a street. Slow traffic way down, and narrow it way down. That's doable here, but because of the right of way width, I think the first option is a better choice. \n\nThis is not a dense neighborhood that making it pedestrianized and closed to vehicular traffic makes sense.",

      "This was going on for a while at my complex. Everyone knew which apartments they were coming from and started complaining to the office enough, and calling the police enough. After a few months, all their families were evicted for breaking terms of the lease. Sucks, but ultimately they should have been parenting their children, and it‚Äôs not like they didn‚Äôt get a shit ton of warnings. Getting off-topic there, but definitely contribute to that paper trail if these kids are from within the complex. The more ammo your complex has against them, the quicker they can handle the issue",
      "Same thing in my complex. Apparently it was a woman who didn't even live here but whenever she visited her friend in this complex she always pulled the alarm. According to the front office she assaulted multiple staff members and was arrested several times. The guy she was visiting got evicted because of all of this and now we haven't had any alarms since the eviction.",
      "Sorry OP. Messing with people's sleep or quiet enjoyment of the home is seriously awful. I'm thankful because the only thing the teens in my complex are interested in is sneaking into the hottub after hours. And that's fine by me because I'll never get within 20 feet of their gross sex tub anyway. Hope you get some better sleep tonight!",
      "A few years ago the complex I was in had some teens pulling the fire alarm at all hours of the night. At the time I had 3 children under 3 years old (twins and baby brother) plus two large dogs. On several occasions the alarm got set off at 2 am. Since my husband worked nights at the time that left me to evacuate all of them by myself. It was frustrating and exhausting to say the least. \nThe whole complex knew who was doing it. Multiple people complained to management, and also spoke with police. The only thing that was ever done was ‚Äúverbal warnings‚Äù and threat of eviction. We ended up moving out before they did and last I heard it was still happening after I left.",

      "What gym are you going to? I froze my membership months ago but felt like golden‚Äôs routes weren‚Äôt that far from of typically. Baker‚Äôs lead wall was hit or miss - I‚Äôve been on some 12+s there that felt harder than climbs of the same grade outdoors. Also I‚Äôm not sure why you say you‚Äôre surprised to find jugs on a 5.10 - they‚Äôre all over 5.10s outside too. I mean Jesus I just did Sonic Youth on Sunday - that‚Äôs 5.13a and is almost entirely jugs.\n\nIn general the gym grades are gonna be softer on walls that allow TRing and at the lower grades for a number of reasons - and gym climbing in general will always be easier than outdoors. The routes are shorter. You can see every hold and have a pretty good idea exactly how good it will be before you ever leave the ground. Friction is generally excellent. You‚Äôll almost never find bad feet. Luckily the days are just about long enough for climbing after work to be feasible for most front rangers.",
      "I find indoor climbs to have much more variable grades than outside. Outside there is a broad consensus, however, inside has a small consensus of a handful of routesetters which creates a bit of a bubble sometimes. This bubble gets smaller when the grades go up, as fewer routesetters can climb the harder grades. The routesetters get to decide what is fair for the grade, not the people climbing it. It also boils down to experience. I'm more of an outdoor climber, so I find indoor climbing to often be harder than the grade outside, and I'm not alone in that. I have friends who climb 13 outdoors and find the 12-'s at Movement Golden harder than said 13's. And for bouldering the upper end of the grades (V8 and up) tend to have a +/- 2 grade difficulty around them. This is especially apparent at Englewood which has decently soft lower grades and a very inconsistent and often sandbagged range at the upper end. The best thing to do at the gym is just to climb what gives you some challenge and not think about the grades too much.",
      "just take the grade and subtract 1 and it's a decent ballpark relative to outdoor",
      "I‚Äôm actually a proponent of making the routes easier. Gets more people climbing and increases new comers to try harder and harder routes. If you want something insanely difficult go out side it my mentality. \n\nI‚Äôve always taken the approach that you‚Äôre training in a gym and pushing outside you want your training to be easier as you‚Äôll do many more climbs inside instead of outside. \n\nBut yes baker is usually easier than golden or centennial. I find the bouldering in RINO to be pretty hard",
      "I was at Golden last night but usually do Baker or RiNo. Golden routes are rated half a rating bellow similar Baker and RiNo routes. In NYC there is a more stark and well known pattern of ratings getting easier as you get further from outdoor climbing. The Palisades has no climbing areas so the you have to go north or west if the suburbs for outdoor climbing.",

An interesting contrast. Eddie said this chili crunch thing is overblown and just haters or journos taking a cheap shot when they can. That said, this is not far from trying to trademark \"kimchi\" or something that's been around forever, I don't get it. Seems way out of line.\n\n  \nI have been a fan of Chang's cooking and restaurants for a while, but I have noticed his recent tend toward commercialization and hawking products/dry goods instead of running restaurants. In particular, my favorite was his Michelin star rated spot \"Ko\" that was formerly run by the great chef Sean Alex Gray and served what are now regarded as \"haute\" classics like shaved foie gras with ice cream or potato chips with caviar and poached egg. I really liked that place and was sad to hear it closed. Specifically, I heard they closed it with maybe not even a week or 2's notice for staff.

Whatever happened wasn't okay as you were a child. Are you after money or retribution(wanting them to be imprisoned?) It's going to be difficult to prove this now that you're 21 and will be quite costly to do. If it's money that you're primarily after I think you would have a lot better outcome if you secure your inheritance/trust fund(assuming they're wealthy wealthy) and then go more of a distant relationship route than suing them in court. \n\nNot sure about your situation, but suing another person is a massive undertaking and will likely alienate siblings, aunts/uncles, grandparents, cousins, family friends etc as they'll be in a way forced to pick sides and unfortunately its often not in the person bringing on the lawsuits favor because they're seen as the one initiating and causing the drama. I grew up in a rather affluent family and have seen similar situations happen with family friends and it never ends up working out for really anyone whatsoever in the scenario. I'd urge you to really research how it played out for others (I assume youtube you'll be able to find ppl telling their story) and maybe talk to other family members and see where they stand with all of it.\n\n Also getting a good idea of what your families longterm plan is for their wealth as maybe you have a significant sum of money coming your way at 27(age most trusts initially pay out) that by suing your parents you'd end up causing a lot of harm to your mental health and end up getting removed from any inheritance etc. Do your parents still support you financially at the moment? If so that is somehting to really consider as you likely would get cut off by initiating something like this. I wish you luck whatever route you choose and sorry you experienced this during your childhood.",

I just feel like I'm paying for a lot of stuff that I'll never use and $102/month is pretty expensive for a gym. I also don't think the facilities are that great, at least not at the baker gym. Most of the treadmills are pretty worn down. They also don't have a sauna which I've heard the Oregon movement gyms have. \n\nI also think Movement oversells memberships. Even at 3PM the gym is too crowded. After 5 it's difficult to get a full workout in in just 1 hr.   \n  \nDon't know much about DBC but it's even closer to my house and it's cheaper so I'm gonna give it a try.",
      "Which part of town are you in? I‚Äôve been a member at both gyms. DBC used to have superior setting compared to Movement, but that has gone downhill in the past 1-2 years after their head setters left. The community aspect of DBC was better.\n\nDBC has lifting equipment at all their locations. The South location has the least equipment of their 3 gyms. If you‚Äôre just doing free weights and not specific machines, they have everything you need.\n\nMovement is a big gym, and if the social aspect is important to you, probably a bit harder to meet people. The setting varies depending on which location ‚Äî Baker has high quality sets, second is probably Englewood and Golden / RiNo are similar. They also just opened a Centennial location next to IKEA which IMO has the best lifting area of all their gyms. You‚Äôll also never run out of fresh routes to climb between all the locations in the area. \n\nMy opinion is that Movement has a bit more to offer, and the monthly price is reflective of that. Bonus being that they are in other states and if you travel to places where they have locations, that is a huge plus. The gyms are indeed busy, and if you can swing climbing during off hours, it‚Äôs a much better experience.",
      "DBC! Their 24hr membership makes life so much easier.",
      "I lifted regularly at DBC for a while. Pending what equipment you're after, they might be lacking, but I'm firmly of the opinion that barbells/squat rack/bumper plates and dumbbells are all you need, and theirs are in good condition. The 24 hr membership is great, and it's rarely crowded.\n\nThe only reason I would do Movement again is to get back into top rope/lead, or if I liked crowds.\n\nETA: I have spent time lifting at North and Central and will vouche for the equipment. I have climbed at all 3, and while south is small, I have enjoyed all 3 and continue to enjoy Central.",
      "I think movement is fine. The weight area is a bit plus, the different classes and meet ups are nice to have, not to mention the different options for gyms/climbing styles. \n\nI really think the route setting at Englewood has gone downhill over the last couple of months. They lost a couple of good setters, and I think some or the former  setters have been spending a lot of time getting Centennial up and running.",
      "I like The Spot.",
      "DBC. They have free weights at every gym, the setting is superior, it doesn't get as busy, and they have 24hr memberships which are very worth it.",
      "I can compare DBC central and movement englewood, have climbed at both alot over several years. \n\nDbc central is more old school setting. Thuggy moves, often shouldery that are more efficient to cut feet on. Their wall design is fine, but not great to smear on. The workout equipment is not extensive. It allows dogs. It's peak busy times are not as long as englewoods or as intense.  \n\nMovement englewood has more space and probably my favorite wall design in all of denver. There is more variety in setting, but I think their current setters lack creativity in the v8-11 range. Imo, DBC setters are better at making hard climbs out of complex/hard movements, Movements setters tend to rely on using worse holds. Movement has large workout area. No dogs allowed. The peak times at englewood have become absurd, bordering on a safety issue. I consider it unusable from 5-9pm M-R.",
      "DBC has no value in comparison. Setting, facilities, class offerings, just about everything is better at Movement and it's only marginally more expensive. I was at DBC for a year and didn't enjoy it at all. Just my opinion.",
      "Ubergrippen",
      "Which DBC location? South is really small, very little equipment, and the walls are smooth so you can‚Äôt really smear effectively. The walls are shorter than Movement though which helped me a lot with my fear of heights. We dropped our DBC membership and switched back to Movement when their sets started getting more difficult than the grade implied. That was over a year ago so not sure how they are now."

The Sun analyzed ambulance trips transporting skiers and snowboarders from resorts to trauma centers.

What a waste of everyone's time, including the people speaking.",
      "&gt; How Does Public Comment Work Right Now in Denver?\n\n&gt;Denver isn't currently considering limiting public comment. Each Monday, there is a recess for thirty minutes of public comment at 5 p.m., between council‚Äôs sessions that start at 3:30 and 5:30 p.m. People sign up beforehand and can comment in person or online. How Does Public Comment Work Right Now in Denver?  \n  \nThose procedures exist because of efforts back in 2016 and 2020 by Councilman Paul Kashmann, who pushed for council to hear comments every week and have them televised, as the rest of council‚Äôs meetings were.¬† Previously, public comment was only allowed once a month and wasn‚Äôt televised.  \n  \n‚ÄúIt's fair to give the public an opportunity to address their elected officials as a body,‚Äù Kashmann says. ‚ÄúWe've got thirteen good people on city council, is my feeling. We've got a whole bunch of good folks working in the administration. But we've got about 750,000 people living in the City and County of Denver, and by not giving them a chance to speak, I think we're probably missing out on some good ideas.‚Äù  \n  \nIn 2022, council changed its rules to prioritize those who have never spoken at a meeting. It‚Äôs currently testing out a pilot program in which those under eighteen get priority at the first meeting of every month, too.  \n  \nEvery Denver councilmember with whom¬†*Westword*¬†spoke emphasized the value of public comment; several pointed out that open public comment doesn‚Äôt exist at other levels of government."

If I was a landlord I would rather a unit sit vacant than to let in a troublesome tenant I may never get rid of.  The only part I agree with is the 90 notice to vacate. I‚Äôm not sure why they couldn‚Äôt just pass that as a stand alone bill.",
      "A feel good bill that actually changes almost nothing. Just pass a bill that requires 90 days of notice from landlords for non-renewal.",
      "This bill is a great way to get landlords to offset rising costs by... you guessed it... raising rent.",
      "So for everyone in here being flippant about how this is just landlords angry about nothing, that landlords don't do anything, that there are no risks involved to landlords for renting, and that this bill really isn't that bad, allow me to give you the perspective of someone who is both a landlord and a lawyer.\n\nI rent one single family home. It was the first home I ever owned, and when we purchased another home we decided to rent instead of selling it. Honestly, much of the reason was sentimental, and I thought it might be a good place to let my kids live when they went to college. I've never raised rent, even with the massive property tax increase I had to absorb. I also handle evictions and have seen how taxing it is on the finances of someone who has to evict a tenant, or even just begin to take the steps to evict a tenant when the tenant isn't paying rent, for example. Just imagine that you paid a $1,000+ monthly bill that someone promised you they'd pay you back for, and how much that would affect you when they didn't or when they were late getting you the money. Now imagine having to listen to people complain about how unfair it is that you can't tell them you're not loaning them money anymore because in their opinion they weren't severely late enough, or didn't otherwise cause you enough harm (again, in the opinion of someone not having to live through it). And at the end of the day, as someone who is deeply liberal, I don't like the government intruding on my property rights and telling me I have to let someone continue living in my home unless I meet some pre-approved reasons.\n\nI will very likely raise rent over this to help cover the increased risk that I'll have to deal with things I didn't have to worry about before, and not give any leeway to anyone who is late. Oftentimes you can see the beginnings of issues with tenants, and previously you could make the judgment call to not renew them to hopefully avoid a mess in the future. The fact that the legislature thinks I should have to deal with a ton of nonsense just to have the right to only put up with it *for an additional 90 days* is absurd. Tenants think this is good for them, but it isn't.",
      "A few thoughts (if Polis signs, which is debatable):\n\n* Will be interesting to see how courts interpret the ban on retaliatory rent increase in combination with the rent control ban.  Both are statutory, so the ban on retaliatory increases almost certainly wins out.  Someone will need to pay to find out, though.\n\n* Adding complexity to landlord/tenant relationships is good for lawyers.\n\n* Preventing landlords from removing a tenant at the end of the lease (and requiring them to continue to accept the tenancy) arguably amounts to an unconstitutional taking under the Supreme Court's recent decision in *Cedar Point Nursery v. Hassid*.  That should be fun litigation for the AG's office.",
      "This is what happens when your elected officials are entitled. A rental property is a business, just like any other business, should be allowed to say it no longer **wants** to do business with specific people (non renewal of a rental contract), for any purpose, after the terms of the contract have been fulfilled. I don't own a rental property yet but intend to build one before the end of 2025 on property I inherited. \n\nI'm hoping u/jaredpolis see's this as a major overstep of government powers and veto's it.",
      "Does the 90 day notice to vacate affect a month to month lease?",
      "while florida is moving in the right direction cracking down on squatters and people stealing the resources of hard working landlords, this state is going further down the tubes of winking at criminals and making it easy for deadbeats to live in places longer without recourse. **THIS** kind of garbage is what makes housing prices high.",
      "I‚Äôm going to raise the rent on my existing tenants because my risk is increasing. I have 2 rental properties. I‚Äôm not a huge corporation. The benefits have to outweigh the risks or I‚Äôm not going to do it. I‚Äôll sell the prop or try do Airbnb.\n\nEDIT: I haven‚Äôt raised rent on anyone since they‚Äôve moved in. I eat the rise in taxes and insurance annually. I pay the extra trash bill. The cost of finding a new tenant typically feels like an offset for messing with the rent for a good tenant. This is just pushing over the edge.",
      "This bill is insane. While I think everyone deserves protections this bill goes too far. Especially the carve out that says if a landlord wants to move a family member in, they must renew, if there is a similar unit nearby. So you want my family member to pay more instead of living in ‚Äúmy‚Äù property? That‚Äôs just fucking stupid. \n\nAlso, I didn‚Äôt see it in the article but if the LL is required to give 90 days, I hope they are requiring the T is required to give 90 days prior to a lease ending, but based on the last bill that was passed idt that‚Äôs true",
      "It probably will increase rents a little. I know people are saying landlords are already charging as much as they can, but consider that this doesn't just increase the 'risk' for landlords, it decreases risk for tenants (which is kind of the point of the bill).\n\nI used to live in San Francisco, which has rent control for older buildings, and no rent control for newer ones. I would have paid a higher rent for a rent controlled unit than for an equivalent non rent controlled one, because I valued the security of knowing my landlord couldn't raise my rent an arbitrary amount each year, and moving is expensive.\n\nA way that could manifest is that people with the means to buy a house may hold off longer because renting becomes less risky, which increases the demand in the rental market.",
      "90 days to vacate would be amazing! My current landlord (American Property Solutions) gave me less than 30 days and tried to insist I pay holdover rates while they drag their feet to get me a new lease. I had less than a week to decide if I was staying or going once they got it to me so I had to stay in their leaky moldy building.",
      "This just shifts the cost of the worst tenants to be paid by the best tenants.  It raises lawyer income dramatically and does nothing but make housing more expensive.  It is so much more complicated, less desirable to be a landlord and will decrease the units, especially single family houses available which will raise rents dramatically.  I don‚Äôt see how this is a win for anyone except the super liberal who fake like it‚Äôs ‚Äúfor your protection‚Äù but it‚Äôs for sure just a new tax in everything but name.  Shame on Polis for not seeing that this hurts housing and he needs to increase supply to lower prices.  What the hell are they waiting for?  Approve Additional dwelling units like Austin.  We need cheaper housing, not building in the renters paying for the people who are shitty tenants.",

      "Horrible Things Film Club, is hosting a free screening of Kiyoshi Kurosawa's 1997 Breakthrough Japanese Horror feature \"CURE\"\n\nA wave of gruesome murders is sweeping Tokyo. The only connection is a bloody X carved into the neck of each of the victims. In each case, the murderer is found near the victim and remembers nothing of the crime. Detective Takabe and psychologist Sakuma are called in to figure out the connection, but their investigation goes nowhere. An odd young man is arrested near the scene of the latest murder, who has a strange effect on everyone who comes into contact with him. Detective Takabe starts a series of interrogations to determine the man's connection with the killings.\n\nAs part of our ongoing series focused on Japanese Horror Cinema, on Thursday, April 11th, we'll screen this excellent film and host a post-screening discussion.\n\nThis Horrible Things Film Club screening event is free and open to the public. However, the first 25 people to RSVP using Eventbrite will receive a special event-attendee-only collectible.\n\n[RSVP via EVENTBRITE here.](https://www.eventbrite.com/e/cure-1997-free-screening-event-tickets-878647657797?aff=oddtdtcreator)",

But if you choose to, your neighbor is responsible for 1/2 the cost.  And vice versa.\n\nIt's best to work with your neighbor on an agreement, if it's a fence between properties and at least one of you wants to replace.",
      "tell your neighbor some of what you just told us.   Our wild ride with the weather isn't over (evidently), so maybe they won't want an exact replacement either.   If they do, I would just fork over your half.",

They also wanted a short 5 foot installment.\n\nWe didn't really want that and wanted maximum privacy from them if possible and planned to just pay for what we wanted but they jumped the gun and informed us a replacement fence was scheduled asking for money on a crumbled invoice we found in our yard.\n\nWe didn't bother at that point and just let them do what they wanted. It's not perfect but we didn't have to pay and they were never very nice about it throughout the process.",

      "Split rail?",
      "You do not have to replace a fence unless you have some HOA requiring it. Fences are weird‚Äî it‚Äôs goes like this: A fence ON the property line is shared ownership. You must have the neighbors agreement to remove it or put it up ON the property line, but since this one was already there, you can repair it (carefully and without fully removing it) with out their agreement/approval. \n\nThat said‚Äî they don‚Äôt HAVE to share the cost. This is one of those things that is nice, when repairing or putting in a fence neighbors often share the cost to be neighborly. \n\nIf they don‚Äôt, you can still repair it at your expense on the property line. Or, If they don‚Äôt choose to share the cost, then you can erect a new fence entirely inside your property line. That means the fence is your property alone. \n\nThis also works the other way‚Äî if you don‚Äôt want to fix the fence, you don‚Äôt have to! And you don‚Äôt have to pay for it! If they want a fence, then they can repair it or put up a new fence on their own property.",
      "There is no obligation for your neighbor to help pay to replace the fence.  A good neighbor will, but that doesn't always happen. If they don't want to help with the cost, you have the right to build any type of fence you like (as long as it mets the requirements of the city) on your side of the property line.",

It‚Äôs most likely on your shared property line now, at least if it was done right in the first place. \n\nI‚Äôm personally against privacy fences because our neighbors that have one had their housebroken into BECAUSE the ‚Äúdoor knockers‚Äù could easily be hidden by the privacy fence and break in the back door. They‚Äôre also really ugly after getting blasted by the sprinklers. \n\nLots of folks live by the mantra ‚Äúfences make good neighbors‚Äù, but I prefer to actually socialize and be nice to my neighbors. So I guess it depends on your personality",
      "From what I read on r/legaladvice, the person that the fence posts face is the owner of the fence. Or if you build a fence, that has to face you. Probably best to talk with your neighbor. They may hate it too.¬†",
      "I don't see any statutes relating to residential fences in particular, and the laws about shared ownership appear particular to agricultural land. However, it's not unusual as a matter of common law for boundary fences to be treated as easements for the opposite side's property. That is, you'd have an easement (right to access) the the opposite side of the fence. Since the \"user\" of an easement is responsible for maintaining it, this creates a mutual responsibility for costs applicable to both sides.\n\nSo, the result is basically the same as the statute applicable to agricultural land, but you'd have to bring private action to enforce it."

MPB used to be more chill and progressive. Then 3-4 years ago, the archbishop moved the pastor Fr Pat (who was there from when I was in second grade) to Holy Family and assigned a brand new young priest there who was a really poor fit for the community and it kind of fractured. St Ignatius used to be good but the Jesuits couldn‚Äôt staff them any more and the new order of priests is very conservative. I no longer live in Denver (moved for grad school) but per my mom it‚Äôs pretty much Holy Family or going to mass at Regis University these days. She watches mass virtually a lot and gets her spiritual fulfillment volunteering with the Ignatians.¬†\n\nEdit: and yes, Archbishop Aquila is a nut, and a lot of this is because of him. ¬†",

The folks there were super-accommodating and we got great photos in places tourists don't usually go.

I needed a haircut, so we got a photo of Stanley in the barber's chair at Emily Griffith with a student \"cutting\" his hair. \n6. I was getting acupuncture at the time, so I got photos of Stanley getting the needle treatment, too (the practitioner's mom is an elementary school language arts teacher, so she was thrilled to participate). \n7. We went to Colorado Springs and took pictures at Garden of the Gods adn the Air Force Academy, but didn't make it to the Olympic Training Center. \n8. We went to the Denver Museum of Nature and Science and took some hilarious pictures with the T-Rex in the lobby and among the dioramas. \n9. I couldn't take him inside the US Mint, so I found a spot on the top floor of a nearby parking garage and took a picture of him with the loading dock in the background. \n10.

      "Utility-scale builds are way more cost-effective from a wider perspective. Individual consumers may benefit from BTM",
      "How much higher are you willing to have your personal bill be in order to pay for this? \n\nRooftop solar has some advantages as you mention (reduced demand on transmission infrastructure and no transmission losses) but also higher costs because building and managing a ton of small unique projects is inherently more expensive than a single big project. In some cases, the benefits of rooftop may outweigh the costs, but in general building a lot of large scale solar will be essential to meet targets are the lowest cost possible.",
      "[deleted]",
      "Maybe I‚Äôm not being imaginative enough but I don‚Äôt see how that could be cost effective or make any sense. Who owns the panels/infrastructure in that case? Who owns the power generated by them? What compensation could they give the building owner for using their property? Who is responsible when the panels need to be removed because the building‚Äôs roof needs maintenance?",
      "&gt; It would lower chances of wildfires and outages¬†\n\n\nHow? A downed power line does not care how much power was going through it before it fell.\n\n\n&gt; They could create lease to own programs that would transfer to owners.¬†¬†\n\n\nWhy would it need to be Xcel?",
      "Xcel bad\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n Shower me in upvotes, now",
      "They did. But as pointed out, there is no battery backup. \n\nXcel years ago knocked on doors and asked to install solar panels on people's homes because they weren't meeting power generation regs from renewables. If people agreed, they got a set amount as a credit for a period of time. I remember them asking our household and the lack of a battery made me say no.\n\nSolar is *not* the problem. It's the fact that the loop goes back into the grid directly from the panels.",
      "99% of residential solar is grid tied. No power from the grid, no power generation from the inverters. You‚Äôd need battery backup. It‚Äôs way more cost effective for Xcel to build and manage large scale utility solar sites as well. If you‚Äôre a utility company serving almost 4 million customers with electricity and you‚Äôre trying to meet renewable goals you‚Äôre not going to be thinking of slapping up 5-8 kW residential rooftop systems. You‚Äôre thinking in megawatts or gigawatts. Besides, there‚Äôs plenty of residential solar companies in Colorado that are basically already doing this work for them. The only real benefit to Xcel doing this is that, in theory, the meter release and interconnection could happen faster than it currently does.",
      "So a handout to property owners? Not saying I'd be against it, but understand what you are saying. Also, to withstand the wind event that happened yesterday each home would also have to come with a battery...so $$$$.\n\nThe obvious issues with this is property rights. Are homeowner going to willingly put basically an easement on there roofs? Who pays if there is damage? Who pays for removal if there needs to be a new roof? Homeowners would have to pay market electric rates and the lease to own fees... It doesn't make much sense.",

There's more I could possibly do if I gave up my own lifestyle and lived in a minimalist one room apartment.\n\nI'd like every skyrise to have that 3M solar film on their windows feeding into batteries and the grid. I'd like to create walkable cities with rail lines running between. It's easy to solve all of our problems with everyone else's money. Unfortunately you can't get people and greed out of the equation.",

      "The Bell Policy Center does a lot of good research on economics in Colorado and impacts to working and middle class families. It‚Äôs not a pretty picture. \n\nhttps://www.bellpolicy.org/wp-content/uploads/InflationBrief2.pdf",
      "Yes it‚Äôs tough! If it‚Äôs part of the city‚Äôs affordable homeownership program then the income for a single person household is capped at something between like 60%-120%  of the area median income (depending on the specific property‚Äôs restriction). \n\nYou also won‚Äôt be approved for a loan for one of these unless your monthly payment is like 35% or less of your monthly income. So the potential buyer pool is very small. I‚Äôm not able to say if the program is effective or not but I know you have to be in the exact sweet spot of earning enough to be able to afford it but not too much to top out of eligibility.",
      "You're right. The monthly payment and the income cap doesn't make sense. However the people I've talked to about this exact topic say there's additional support to make the payments. To own a house in Denver, you either need to be broke or rich. Anything in between and you're out of luck.",
      "These units are actually really good for retirees. They usually have the ability to make a large down payment, see the HOA as a positive, but they are on a fixed income so having a small mortgage instead of renting is a great choice.",
      "If you don‚Äôt make $100k+ the 25-35% of income rule is a joke now.\n\nStick to it if you want but it seems quite conservative.",
      "It's not great but that's totally doable on a mediocre income. It won't be easy but it's not completely cost prohibitive. But you'd better have stable employment. Definitely couldn't do it at 35k though, that's absurd.\n\nedit: btw where is this $350k house?",
      "And good luck finding anything $350,000. That's condo territory with upstairs neighbors.",
      "I have an affordable unit for sale in Denver rn. They gave me the max price to list it. 2B 1B 900sqft @$272k- renovated in 2017. \n\nIt is the base amount I paid plus 3.5% appreciation per year. Which, allegedly,  is less than market rate. \n\nI got it at a discount when I purchased and it takes 15 years to slide back to market rate. \n\nI‚Äôve had about 10-12 showings in the past few weeks and Zero interest. My unit is the worst in the building in the basement, bc that‚Äôs where the poors go. No one wants it. I‚Äôm now my investment is stuck in affordable housing and I make more than twice the qualification limit. I no longer want or need affordable housing and I‚Äôd like someone who needs it to use it. \n\nI want to sell it to someone in need of the ‚Äúdiscount‚Äù but it seems to already be at market rate and I still have 8 years of appreciation. \n\nThey also raised qualification from 80% AMI when I bought to 90% AMI and wages have gone way up. A couple can make up to $94k and still qualify, but they‚Äôd need a sizable downpayment to keep within the limit of their mortgage AND HOA being less than 35% of their monthly take home pay. \n\nI was in a tough spot when I bought it and it served its purpose. My plan was to own it for 5 years, but in Sept I‚Äôll have it for 7. I‚Äôve listed it twice. I‚Äôm really hoping it sells this time.",
      "Denver is a desirable place to live.\n\nBut it would be nice if there were some serious regulations made about owning multiple single family homes and renting them out and make it impossible to hide identities with shell corporations, or at least have people pursue them harder... but yeah, that's likely not going to happen because that's how a lot of wealthy people make their money / hide it or what they are doing to make it.  \nPlus, the government gets its money from taxes. Not many really want prices to go down. Historically, it almost never happens. \n\nIt stinks too, because home ownership is good for neighborhoods. I'm glad I didn't have to grow up around a bunch of houses being bought up and rented out like 4-6 unit buildings.\n\nBest you can do is keep getting desirable skills / experience and live frugally for a few years and save like crazy. If places like San Fran, NYC, London, and tons of cities in China and other places around the world have shown, it can and almost certainly will get worse.",
      "No but it is for Colorado.",
      "Without knowing exactly what you‚Äôre looking at it‚Äôs hard to know how they‚Äôre defining ‚Äúaffordable‚Äù but typically that‚Äôs a percentage of median income. One of the higher levels of affordable housing is usually ~80% of area median income. According to this [fact sheet](https://www.denvergov.org/files/assets/public/v/1/housing-stability/documents/2023-incomerent-limits/host-income-rent-limit-2023-mah.pdf) from the city, that‚Äôs about $80,000 for a 2 person household, which would be in line with your calculations. Yeah, that‚Äôs still a lot of money but it is technically ‚Äúaffordable‚Äù from the city‚Äôs definition. It‚Äôs definitely a factor of things being priced for dual income families and a relatively high median family income in the area.",
      "Absolutely not. There‚Äôs literally an ‚Äúaffordable‚Äù home in boulder county that can‚Äôt be sold because they ask more than a person can pay on the restricted income limits. It can never be sold again unless they change the income limits or the market crashes.",
      "Who is setting people up for failure?",
      "Those programs are tied to something called area median income. You are correct though, these non-profit industrial complex subsidized housing programs don‚Äôt actually do much for housing affordability",
      "Its not even the home prices for me, its these stupid HOAs asking for $500+/mo for a HOUSING DEVELOPMENT (not a condo). The house prices on top of it all just adds insult to injury. \n\nBut no $350k is bot ‚Äúaffordable‚Äù for the vast majority of people.",
      "Technically it is affordable. A 2 person partnership could afford it if both had full time minimum wage jobs. The hardest part would be for these two to save up a downpayment. The reality is that someone who makes a low wage but comes from a better off family will get a downpayment from their parents and swipe this from the people it was intended for.",
      "I am actually hoping to buy a place through affordable housing. My partner and I make 85000 combined working in education and non profit. I‚Äôve been trying to buy and keep thinking we must be some of the only people who could actually make it work. But my friend who lives in some told me it‚Äôs lots of medical students who apply and their parents give them cash down payments. Then they sell as soon as they graduate or finish residency.So even if you do qualify, rich people still game the system for their own benefit. It‚Äôs such a bummer. We are mostly concerned about our autistic son and want to make sure he has a place to live when he gets older. It‚Äôs tough out there!",
      "I know this won‚Äôt help your specific situation but \nit‚Äôs a good reminder you cannot subsidize or redistribute or government-program your way to affordable housing.  Because there is a *shortage of housing.* You have to build more.\n\nWe have five people and four chairs.  It doesn‚Äôt matter how much money you give anyone; you need more chairs.\n\nAnyway vote for upzoning and legalizing higher density housing.  It‚Äôs the only way out of this mess.",
      "You‚Äôre not missing anything. It‚Äôs hard to be in the middle class in Denver.",
      "That's about the avg price of a 900 sq ft apt in Denver. And yeah you have to show 3x rent to qualify to rent anywhere. It's a total racket. How are you supposed to save for a home when you're paying rent? It's unsustainable.",
      "Welcome to the dissolution of the middle class I guess? Yeah it fucking sucks. But you could always‚Ä¶.move somewhere? Sorry I guess I‚Äôm ranting, and I‚Äôm also a pessimist, but it‚Äôs hard not got get mad at the state of things and representation doesn‚Äôt do a gaddamn thing to help.",
      "It‚Äôs not affordable unless you are sharing costs with a roommate/significant other, and even then it will be costly. And that‚Äôs IF you have an application accepted/win the lottery (like DHA housing requires).",
      "ITT: lotta people who still think a crash is coming.",
      "Generally, the pricing and income limits are based on 60-120% of HUDs AMIs, sized for the number of people who are expected to live in the house based on sq ft, # of bedrooms, and other factors. If you‚Äôre looking at a 3BR house, it‚Äôs likely priced to be affordable to a family of 4. Currently 100% AMI for a family of 4 in Denver Metro is [$130K](https://www.huduser.gov/portal/datasets/il/il2024/2024summary.odn?states=%24states%24&amp;data=2024&amp;inputname=METRO19740M19740*Denver-Aurora-Lakewood%2C+CO+MSA&amp;stname=%24stname%24&amp;statefp=99&amp;year=2024&amp;selection_type=hmfa). 30% of that is $3,250.¬†\n\nI am not arguing that pricing isn‚Äôt out of control, and I agree that affordable housing programs are not meeting the needs of everyone who wants to own a home in Denver. I just wanted to provide accurate math, since OP is leaning so hard into the math of it all.",
      "Interest rates are still pretty high and it‚Äôs not like they‚Äôre just handing out houses, it still takes a lot of work and budgeting !",
      "This is why I‚Äôm glad I no longer work in IT for a mortgage company. I still have friends in the industry and they are having to work a lot harder to bring in business. \n\nI had to have people who I used to work with sign some insurance checks after a payout to replace my siding after a windstorm last year (I refi‚Äôd with that company a couple years ago), and the manager who could sign them asked me what my rate was. As soon as I got ‚Äútwo‚Äù out of my mouth he agreed that I would be stupid to refi again. \n\nWhen the market starts to crash the first people laid off from companies like that will be the ones who don‚Äôt actively bring IN money to the coffers.",

      "I‚Äôm making exactly the median (66K/yr) and I‚Äôve accepted that I‚Äôll never be able to afford a house in this city, except perhaps a shack single level out in the suburbs. Say what you will about renting, the $650/month (my half of rent with my partner) in a nice neighborhood with access to transit is great. \n\nI‚Äôve given up on owning. The incurred costs and the imminent deprecation aren‚Äôt going to catch up with equity. It‚Äôd be nice to have a backyard and garage, but I don‚Äôt see much in the way of appreciation. The bubble is going to burst soon. \n\nI‚Äôll rent for now, not have kids, sacrifice the fenced backyard for the walkable neighborhood, and pray the landlord doesn‚Äôt raise the rent. He hasn‚Äôt in five years. \n\nOwning is for people who make six figures or more, not us commoners.",
      "AMI programs do not help much of the working class. Where I'm at, some of the AMI programs are 75k a year for two people and that's at 120 percent of AMI. \n\nThat's not a lot for two middle class/upper middle class earners.",

      "I agree - the price structure of these units is unrealistic. You have to make poverty wages to qualify. Even with a grant the monthly payments will be higher than someone in that tax bracket to afford",

      "Hi! My girlfriend and I were unfortunately not able to adopt as we already have a pup and decided against it. But we followed Dexter/Malcolm‚Äôs journey from OP to Foothills, and would like to help out with adoption fee. I‚Äôm not sure the best way to go about this, but if you adopt this sweet boy, please DM me and we can chat- I will venmo you (or cash meetup honestly if you prefer) to reduce the adoption fee.\n\nEdit: We reached out to Foothills with the intention of fostering this guy- they do not allow fostering for dogs on their adoption floor! Just FYI for anyone out there thinking the same.",
      "Please remove if this is not allowed: [Dexter Petfinder](https://www.petfinder.com/dog/dexter-71215393/co/golden/foothills-animal-shelter-co91/)\nDexter is a 10 month old lab mix that recently god neutered! I took him to Foothills Animal Shelter for his 5 day waiting period to find his owners. However no one ever claimed him. He got his behavioral assessment done and has officially been neutered! He is such a love bug and demands cuddles on the couch/bed. He has adorable puppy energy with the best zoomies! I can see him being an amazing hiking/backpacking buddy! He is very shy in the beginning of getting to know you as his trauma of being abandoned is still new. But with the help of treats, love, and patience he will be snuggling up to you in no time! He would do well with another dog who can show him the ropes of being a happy dog. I‚Äôm posting this because as much as I wish I could adopt him for myself, I don‚Äôt have the schedule that would allow me to tend to his needs the way he deserves. He has so much love to give and deserves to find his perfect forever home filled with love.",
      "He is so dang cute!! ‚ô•Ô∏è",
      "He looks just like my labs! I got one of my labs from Foothills and their pups are usually $500. Well worth it though!",
      "I would bet money he is half Lab half Border Collie.",
      "I had a lab mix that looked exactly like this one. She lived 15 happy years. Watch out for ACL injuries caused by running up and down stairs."

      "‚ÄúIs Tracks getting louder?‚Äù No. The sound system at Tracks Denver hasn‚Äôt fundamentally changed since it opened. Things get ‚Äòrefreshed‚Äô as they age, but the design is the same and there isn‚Äôt a ton of room to add much more that would significantly change your perception. What you‚Äôre hearing is probably ReelWorks. So‚Ä¶\n\n‚ÄúIs ReelWorks getting louder?‚Äù Maybe. For many years ReelWorks was a variable event space that would change based on need. The main sound system was transformable (in a limited sort of way) to adapt to event size and shape. It primarily faced west (away from Tracks, the nightclub part of the block, in the center of the greater structure). A couple of years ago the space changed from being ‚Äúevent‚Äù (conferences, weddings, etcetera) driven (day) to more club focused (night), which included a large-ish revamp of the room and a semi-permanent stage on the western side of the building (along 35th St.) with the sound system facing east (away from the nearby residences). This included a reconfiguration of the sound system and a few more bassbins. That made it a bit louder in the low-end, but hopefully pushed more of the (sometimes really annoying) high-end away from homes. \n\nAnother consideration could be that sometimes promoters using the space like to bring in their own sound systems. The ‚Äúrave-y‚Äù crowds love to hear things like ‚Äúextra Funktion One sound!!1!1‚Äù on their fliers. Coupled with dense, cool air (in which sound travels more easily farther away), this could explain an increase in perceived loudness. \n\nTL;DR: Yeah, maybe. It could be louder, it could just be perception. You moved in next to a large entertainment space; you kinda have to expect that once in a while, yeah?",
      "Nah, you're just getting older. Soon you'll be yelling at kids to get off your lawn. (Jk)\n\n\nOff topic but does anyone else think of heroin abuse by the name Tracks?¬†",

This is their website: https://coloradocrisisservices.org \n\nThere is also Wellpower, which offers mental health services: https://www.wellpower.org/access-services/ They have case managers that may be able to help you navigate the medical system around your mental health needs.\n\nAs an international student you would likely not be eligible for Medicaid. Colorado has a separate program called Behavioral Health Administration (BHA) that may cover some of the expenses associated with treatment.\n\nLastly, your student clinic may have affordable or sliding scale treatment. I hope this information is helpful.",
      "So probably the best treatment is **counseling** or **\"talk therapy.\"** I agree with the other commentors that your school is the first place to look for a therapist. Be aware that there may be limits on how long they can continue to see you. Also, talk therapy can feel awkward at first, especially for non-natives, for whom English might be a second language, or who might not be used to talking openly with, for instance, a stranger or a younger woman. You may have to try to get over your initial discomfort. It will pay off greatly.\n\nAnother thing to consider is **medication**. Your school will have a health clinic that may be able to prescribe antidepressant drugs for you, if they're appropriate and if you are willing to try them. They are quite cheap, fairly effective and (here's the important thing) have relatively mild side effects.\n\nYou should also do some **self care**. Here are some self-care tips for depression.  \n[https://psychcentral.com/depression/self-care-for-depression](https://psychcentral.com/depression/self-care-for-depression)\n\nOne particularly effective approach is **journaling** (writing in a diary), but it has to be a particular kind of journaling. That article explains it, but there are some excellent books just about journaling, like Louise Desalvo's \"Writing as a Way of Healing.\"\n\nAnother effective measure is **exercise**. Just walking is enough. Do it every day, rain or shine.\n\nAnd there is a particular theraputic approach called \"**Acceptance and Commitment Therapy**\" or \"ACT.\" (It's a kind of updated version of cognitive behavioral therapy, which is considered the gold standard by insurance companies.) It can be done alone with a workbook, though having a human therapist do it with you is probably better. On the other hand, the book is cheap and you can work on it whenever you want.  \n[https://www.amazon.com/Mindfulness-Acceptance-Workbook-Depression-Commitment/dp/1626258457](https://www.amazon.com/Mindfulness-Acceptance-Workbook-Depression-Commitment/dp/1626258457)\n\nLastly, I can tell you what DOESN'T work: trying to \"just snap out of it\" or \"think happy thoughts.\" Depression is a serious medical condition. Recovering will take effort and maybe doing things differently than you used to.\n\nGood luck!",

Was in a similar situation as you, just worked on the car in a rented garage at apartments with the garage cracked (it was winter time)‚Ä¶ definitely sucks but there hasn‚Äôt really been a push for anything to change.",
      "Gearhead garage is closing?!? Ugh, that‚Äôs such a bummer. I was looking for a DIY garage a few weeks ago to do some work on my car and ended up doing it in a parking lot across the street. Had considered gearhead garage but it was just inconvenient enough to drive to the springs. Was looking forward to going there eventually because having a legit lift makes many tasks sooooo much easier.\n\nTo answer your question, I don‚Äôt have any leads either. I did a fair bit of research and basically came up with nothing. I have a few ideas, though:\n\n* Post on one of the Denver specific car enthusiast groups. There‚Äôs a lot of them. Someone might be willing to let you use their garage for a few hours in exchange for some beer as long as you‚Äôre not a weirdo.\n* It might be worth talking to Larimer St Garage. They probably don‚Äôt have the availability to rent the space out, but Joey and Mike are pretty well connected and might be able to give you some guidance on where to look. \n* If all else fails‚Ä¶ the parking lot across from my apartment has worked well enough for me and I doubt you‚Äôd have any issues working on your car there for a day on a weekend. No one has bothered me the last few times I‚Äôve worked there, I just make sure to stay on the edge of the lot on non-business days. Clean up well, etc. \n\nEdit: just saw you‚Äôre planning on doing transmission work so the last suggestion is likely not helpful.",
      "I wish, but there's none I know of. Does your apartment actually stop you from working? It's technically not allowed at mine, but I've never had an issue with working in my detached garage with the door cracked.

Willing to pay of course.¬† ¬†¬†\n\n\nI live in an apartment complex too and still work on my car here and there ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è - only minor repairs though¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†\n\n\nAt my apartment complex the staff doesn't work weekends so I commonly see random neighbors doing small repairs with the hood open on the weekends, but to be honest even during week/workdays I see the odd resident working on their car in broad daylight¬†¬†¬†¬†\n\n\nThe staff here is pretty chill though, so I guess it varies. If you have a bunch of \"nosy\" Karen type staff at your apartment complex then it might be an issue¬†¬†\n\n\nAs a side-note, you can openly work on your car in broad daylight at any auto parts store (AutoZone, advanceauto, Oreilly, etc) parking lot and no one says anything usually, so that's also an option. Same thing at junkyard parking lots, whenever I make a parts run to the junkyard I see cars jacked up/on jack stands and people working on their car right there in the parking lot"

      "[u/bzzzzzzlightyear](https://www.reddit.com/user/bzzzzzzlightyear/), assuming you're asking about things you need to do as a city resident, many people are caught off-guard by the requirement that residents shovel their sidewalk clear of snow within 24 hours after the snowfall stops. My neighbor got a warning followed by a ticket last year because they were out of town and didn't put a plan in place to get their sidewalk shoveled (like ask a neighbor). Also, many, but not all parts of the city have monthly street sweeping from April-November which mean every street in the affect area gets swept once/month. You'll know you're in one of these areas because a street sign will say parking is prohibited on the 3rd Thursday of the month for example. They will absolutely ticket your car if it's there before the street sweeper comes through on that day. Last time I got a ticket, it was $50. May have gone up.

      "Hi Everyone! I have an opportunity to relocate from Michigan to Colorado and work remote from there. I have visited Denver a couple of times in the past and I loved it. I'm really big into hiking and the outdoors in general. I'd love some advice on where to live in Colorado. I was thinking about the Aurora area, I have a friend that lives there already. I am Lebanese so it would be nice to be in an area with some diversity and culture. I'm a female, currently single and in my 30's so feeling safe where I live is very important to me. I would also like to be in an area where I can meet people around my age (late 20s to late 30s) to make new friends/date. Also would love to be in an area where it's close to hiking trails. I'm a runner so I would love an area where I can run outside on some nice trails. My budget for rent is about $1,600. Any suggestions and insight would be much appreciated :)",

There will be some municipality in the area that‚Äôll vote for it, that‚Äôs my guess on where they‚Äôll get the support.  \n\nAs an aside, I have always found Denver to be unpretentious compared to many cities in the US.  Maybe it‚Äôs just who I hang out with.\n\nEdit: as another aside - what is the expected lifespan of a stadium?  In the last year or two there has been talk of a new stadium here and at the time the talk started the stadium was just over 20\nyears old.  I looked up arrowhead stadium and it‚Äôs &gt; 50 years old so that makes more sense that it may be time for a new one‚Ä¶ but &lt;25 years old?",

The \"Denver Metropolitan Major League Baseball Stadium District,\" which is a political subdivision of the state, owns a huge amount of empty developable land downtown (the parking lots that run all the way up to 34th street) so I assume they will be able to keep milking rather than asking for taxpayer money.",
      "Mile High is fine, great location, big enough, iconic, and easily accessible. \n\nThe NFL made over 315 billion last year from broadcasting rights, they can pay for a new stadium if it's really such a big issue.

Once upon a time Denver absolutely would have,  but I feel like we've gotten even more blue, The Waltons are the owners,  and we have a shit ton of transplants who passively root for the Broncos as their 2nd team so why would they want to pay for it.

Would the Denver area consider public funds that helped with access, parkland around said stadium? Maybe, maybe not. It depends on the proposal. \n\nMy point is not that even this would get funding, only that the people of the Denver Area would still consider something as long as it wasn't just replace the stadium with another where all the gains went to billionaires. Something else would have to be on offer. \n\nAnd the main complaint with the National Western Stockshow Arena, was that not that we should never put in for an arena, but that there wasn't enough in the deal to make it good for the neighborhood and the city. That it was just for Stock Show Attendees and Shows put on there. That all the benefit went to a few, especially rich people. \n\nThe people of the Denver Area will not vote to just give another stadium to the Broncos with the benefits only going to the rich. As Mile High redo was done in the past. But we are not populist stupid either which is why Denver over the past 40 years has improved.",

      "I can‚Äôt say how Denver would vote, but I would download another stadium every single time.",
      "Four of Denver‚Äôs professional teams are owned by the Walton/Kroenke empire.  Asides from a sweet-ass ground lease I don‚Äôt see ownership coming back to the public trough.  They own a ton of developable land around Ball Arena and Kroenke would probably be happy to serve as a the developer for the land around a replacement for Mile High in the same area.\n\nI have heard a couple of rumors that Kroenke has slow walked development around Dicks because they want to see if putting an MLS stadium near Ball would be a more lucrative option.  Might not happen due to the amount of land available, but it would be a pretty crazy entertainment district if you had NFL, NBA, NHL, and MLS in that area.",

      "I'm guilty of lane FILTERING before this law was passed, but am very careful when choosing when/where to do it. Really when I'm at an intersection/light that I cross often and am aware of the amount of traffic and distracted drivers. \n\nI commute up and down federal mostly, as well as Sante Fe and Sheridan. All roads in which traffic reaches 40+ mph with lots of stop lights and people on their phones. Given enough space and time, I make my way to the front to avoid getting smoked from behind. \n\nThere are plenty of squid riders that give us a bad name and I won't try and convince anyone they aren't in the wrong, but when you're at a stop light on a motorcycle and see EVERY SINGLE driver on their phone, it's a reality most people don't know they're living in.

Over the years, I have had multiple close calls from autos that didn't notice the bike between them and the car in front while coming to stops. And I have known people hit, maimed and killed the same way. There are riding techniques to help create escape routes, but filtering and slow speed splitting lets you out of that danger zone entirely. \n\nAnd now I'm not sure I will do it even though it's legal because of asshats like a select few in this comment section. I'm not immune to road rage, but I can tell that there are a few commenting here that WILL be the person butthurt about bikes filtering. Who WILL attempt to pinch the lanes down to endanger riders performing legal activities. Who WILL be attempting to open doors in traffic to injure or kill riders riding legally. They don't realize that these actions are attempted murder on a rider. \n\nHelmets on, armor on, stay strapped.

This also alleviates congestion by using road space more efficiently. Of course, there will be asshats on bikes that split lanes well above 15mph, and they are breaking the law and should be ticketed. This is not filtering and has no benefits to safety. My main fear with this new freedom is being on the receiving end of road rage, getting shot by some Karen who doesn't think it's fair. So please spread the word that lane filtering is perfectly legal and helps everyone. Thank you.\n\n\nEdit: downvotes are only confirming my fears, lol. Guys, study after study has been done on this. Lane filtering at stopped lights reduces road fatalities. This bill does not condone or allow lane splitting at speed.",
      "Fantastic.",
      "I moved to Nevada last year, and was shocked by the motorcycle culture here. I'd say there aren't that many more motorcyclists here but they act very entitled. Lane filtering is legal in California, so they think it is here too. It gets re-interpreted by riders, though, who think it means passing between cars in adjoining lanes at 85mph is fine. So there is a lot of passing on the right at a high rate of speed, which means they appear out of nowhere and often in your blind spot. I had one drop his bike behind me as I was doing a very simple return to the right lane after passing a slower moving car maneuver. He had an injury and totaled bike, but fortunately did not hit me. I spoke with the responding patrolman and he definitely didn't think I was at fault. \n\nIn short, you have to be more aware that motorcyclists can be in unexpected locations on the highway in places where lane-splitting is common. Check your right shoulder when merging (and always your left, obviously.)",
      "The bill as written only allows for filtering when cars are stopped which is good but allows it at 15mph which seems fast but we'll just have to see how it goes.\n\nMy main issue is that I don't like loud, fast things moving in and out of my blindspots while I'm in the car. I understand the motorcyclist arguments here but when I'm already trying to keep track of other cars, cyclists, and pedestrians it doesn't seem unreasonable of me to not want one of those obnoxiously loud bikes to suddenly go by driver window.",
      "This is just going to increase the people on motorcycles who weave in and out of cars on the highway while everyone is going 65+. I see it frequently already. It makes sense if, like the article states, cars are stopped or going below 15mph. But we all know that‚Äôs not going to be how this goes.",

      "Can you post a sketch of what you are wanting to do? I get the feeling that you are misreading the setback requirement. \n\nAs I understand it, \"75%\" is used to determine what is considered the front facade of the house. If you have a rectangular house, the front facade is obvious. If part of the house is staggered back, then you have to determine which facade (the one closest to the street or the part set back) constitutes 75% of the front. So if half the house is on one plane and the other half is set back, the facade you measure from is the back one. What you will be measuring is distance **C** shown on the site map on page 5.3-34.\n\n\"10'\" is the minimum distance C that you need to measure from that facade to the nearest wall on the shed. For most houses, this has no impact because the houses are much deeper than that.\n\nEdit: The purpose of this is basically to ensure that the shed or the garage is at least 10‚Äô from the front of your house. \n\nThere are however additional things that determine where the shed can end up:\n\n1. Front 65% vs. back 35%\n2. Distance from side property line/alley/street\n3. Distance from back property line/alley/street\n4. Other existing accessory structures\n5. etc.\n\nThe simplest way is to sketch what you want to do with approximate measurements to property lines and other structures and go talk to someone at the Permit Counter. You can schedule an appointment for Tuesday or Thursday morning here: [https://www.denvergov.org/naoa/](https://www.denvergov.org/naoa/) I see several slots open for this coming Tuesday.\n\nIf there are special circumstances that prevent you from abiding by all the limitations, you can file a request for a zoning variance (after your application is denied for a zoning violation). The board of adjustments that reviews the requests is made up of a bunch of folks that are pretty reasonable and who look for ways to make things work for the applicant.

The drivers here are absolutely insane. I‚Äôve been rear ended at a stoplight while at the front of the line, the driver sped off when we tried to pull over to the side, and the policeman behind them did nothing and also sped right past us despite witnessing it. \n\nAnd the road rage people can get here over their own mistakes is scary sometimes. I‚Äôm worried that this could lead to more road rage incidents where motorcycles just following the law will become targets. I‚Äôm all for filtering, and I really hope I‚Äôm proven wrong here.",

So I'm not here to defend these people at all. \n\nBut I want to provide some context that might be important. There was an accident on I-25 that closed down south bound lanes at I-25 and this re-routed  traffic through Parker and south of town through unincorporated neighborhoods. My neighborhood, Pinery Glen, was one of those neighborhoods. \n\nI was stuck in traffic that day coming back from Parker, and just on Parker road there were several accidents sans cops, people were running red lights and sitting in intersections when the lights turned green, and driving through neighborhoods like bats out of hell. It was just odd to not see any cops in a county and city where they always seemed pretty plentiful. \n\nOnce I got back to my neighborhood the situation was worse. People had decided to cut through our neighborhood to try to get to the back road to Castle Rock where I-25 was open again. People were behaving like it was mad Max. They ignored stop signs, drove up onto sidewalks to avoid other cars, and turned a two way two lane road that's access for two neighborhoods into a one way two lane road. \n\nI didn't call 911, but if anyone in my neighborhood did I wouldn't blame them. I've never seen anything like it, and I wouldn't have believed it if I didn't see it myself. Fucking lunacy.",

      "Jamie Giellis, is that you?\n\n120 years ago, those old school trams were a huge advance over walking everywhere, or riding a carriage. In 2024, those old school trams which run in the street would be as slow or slower than the bus. Unlike the bus, it can't move around obstructions.\n\nPeople way over romanticize trams/streetcars and also misunderstand or exaggerate the reasons for their demise. Besides the speed, our old network's routes and its physical coverage of the metro area was minuscule. By resurrecting it, you get a less useful system than the current RTD network at a very high price tag - where is that money coming from? This would cost billions, in a city that can't afford to staff its rec centers or DMV.\n\nA modern tram system which is largely separate from car lanes and with modern stations, like what's common is midsized French cities, would probably be more useful, but that's essential (a better version of) our light rail system. Which we already have, and which we can't afford to expand. Further, light rail/modern grade separate tramways are good for cities with a smaller footprint, but it's really inappropriate for midsize or large American metro areas, we're far more sprawled out, and much bigger, than Bordeaux or Nantes. We should have used the commuter rail technology that the A-line uses (and gets up to 80 mph) for our whole network and also created far fewer stops to speed it up.\n\nI always appreciate a dreamer who wants to see public transit improve, but asking Chat GPT how to get support for a 120 year old outdated technology isn't going to solve our problems. Given our political and fiscal realities, we need to start by improving and expanding our bus system, and increasing the frequency and reliability of our existing light and commuter rail system. And that includes making our buses, trains and stations safer, and not tolerating them being treated as traveling, Snowpiercer-esque drug dens.\n\nNext realistic step is supporting and expanding the city of Denver's already well developed plans for a bus rapid transit system.",
      "A cute tramway for 16th street is just common sense. It would mostly have a dedicated lane, it gets heavy use, and it would just be better aesthetically. \n\nThe light rail is really the same technology just laid out differently for more of an long distance express service. The L is truly a streetcar, but being just one small line it doesn't get separate branding or rolling stock. With more local oriented light rail lines the L would be rebranded a tramway/streetcar. There is really no reason for a tramway completely separate from the light rail, but but also switching to Low Floor equipment would be smart for the entire system, and with enough local lines buying a fleet with a layout optimized for local service could be smart. \n\nFrom LoDo to 38th and Blake could also do well, and perhaps providing local service withing the proposed River mile development, a Broadway line, or a line in a neighborhood likely to see a lot of new development.",
      "It would be nice. But who is going to do all that work? I‚Äôm pretty busy",
      "The modern version is the BRT and it‚Äôs being built on colfax right now.¬†",
      "Also, in Denver, residents don‚Äôt seem to foster a culture that emboldens light rail staff. A handful of comments so far have been productive yet seemingly defeatist. I don‚Äôt see how this attitude  encourages ppl to work for our current and future light rail system(s).",
      "Did you get your answer out of chatgpt? The asterisks are a bit of a giveaway. \n\n  \nThe way to recreate the convenience of the tramway is to bolster bus service. Many routes like the 52, 15, 0, 12, etc go over old rail routes. While maybe trams could be rebuilt on high density routes like Colfax, its probably just out of the realm of possibility to redo tracks."

Plan to move your most delicate items yourself and ensure large pieces are adequately protected.

You can PM me if you want and depending on logistics I can try to help you. I am also a solo ringleader of this circus I call life! \n  I have not used a mover for personal use, but did have success hiring Seven Brothers Moving in Golden to move some huge flower pots for my customer. I was able to assist him to keep costs low, as each person will up the charge of the move. The business is small which I appreciate the attention to detail. I cannot recall the movers name, but his girlfriend Taylor works the office, and he does the heavy work!  They have assistants as needed as well for larger jobs. He was very non threatening and I felt comfortable the whole time.  I felt they were reasonable in cost, organized and reliable, as sometimes move crews just dont show up.\nThey are all pretty pricey, as these guys literally throw their backs out.",

Multi-purpose probably means there are equine or hiking trails along with public grazing area within the off-leash allowed areas.\n\nAs long as your pet is voice command trained and you use an e collar properly, you shouldn‚Äôt have a problem with your dog running off.\n\nI would most definitely not let them leave my sight both to preserve the safety of my pet as well as any wild life."

The residential prevailing wage for drywall finishers, for example, is $13 per hour. But the commercial prevailing wage for drywallers is significantly higher ‚Äî $21.20. For electricians, the rates are $26.91 per hour for residential and $39.75 per hour for commercial.\n\n‚ÄúThe idea is that if the public is funding construction, and taxpayer dollars are being spent, the people working on that job should earn a dignified wage,‚Äù said Denver Labor executive director Matthew Fritz-Mauer.\n\n\n\nWHY IS THAT SO HARD FOR PEOPLE?",
      "I've commented in the past on how I believe Urban Peak is one of the better run orgs in their space, but this is a major fuck up from their executives.\n\nNo one with any level of savvy in the construction space would think that building qualifies residential. It's not even close. Also agreeing to federal wage scales when this is a community project and not understanding what that meant. They committed to paying east coast union labor rates when the going rate for Denver crews is much much lower.\n\nThen they buried their head in the sand and kicked the can down the road hoping the issue would go away or the city would bail them out with an incorrect ruling.",

(They did handle things like transportation of the body, SSA notifications, and providing death certificates.)\n\nTotal cost IIRC was under $2000, whereas mortuaries/cemeteries had higher price structure.\n\nBTW, the folks I used published their prices on-line and I don't think I found anything similar with other types of providers. Handled a lot of it by phone and, because there really weren't that many choices, no pressure/no upselling.",

      "Any reasonable optometrist/ophthalmologist  can give you what you need.   America's Best or One Hour Glasses or any store front glasses store is a good place to get it. Just explain what you want when you make an appointment.",
      "An eye exam by a licensed optometrist is sufficient.\n\n&gt;Every Coloradan applying for a driver license or permit is required by Colorado Revised Statute 42-2-111(1)(a) to have their eyesight tested for minimum standards established by the Colorado Department of Revenue in coordination with the Colorado Optometric Association, the American Optometric Association and American Association of Motor Vehicle Administrators. The DMV's eye screening is basic and does not take the place of a professional evaluation, should one be required. Vision in either or both eyes must be at least the established minimum of 20/40.\n\nPer State of Colorado.\n\nTo get glasses or contacts that is what an optometrist does and that is who you want to see. The key is you need the results on paper, same now with licenses,  not just some vague a-ok. Say what you need it for, they will get you what you need.\n\n(Normally if you make an eye exam with a place that sells glasses, it is with their optometrist.)\n\n(I went to an optometrist once where someone had talked to staff and not asked them whether they needed an eye exam and was unclear about it, then went to the DMV and said the Optometrist said I didn't need one.. Then tried to blame the optometrist... It was just crazyland to watch someone trying to get them to ok their vision without testing it.)",

      "If you do get an eye exam, be sure to find out ahead of time how long the report is good for. I had an eye exam at Target a year ago in preparation for a license renewal. But when I went to get new glasses a few weeks ago, I learned that the report expired in one year instead of the usual two.\n\nBy the way, it turned out that they did not test my eyesight when I renewed the license. So I didn't have to produce the doctor's when I failed the test (as I usually do) at the DMV.",
      "Yes. I had an eye exam at Americas best before getting a new license. ( such a pain. It had lapsed a year before I noticed and then COVID arrived.It took an entire day (with an appointment) to take the written and the driving exam."

      "I was in gifted programs all through elementary and middle school at multiple schools and I strongly recommend against it. They weren't ever challenging and didn't prepare me in any way for the later years of high school and college. I have a lot of thoughts on this topic but I would strongly suggest to keep your kids in a normal class but a grade level ahead to hopefully teach them good study skills in a normal classroom environment. You have to teach them to fill the gaps left by their lessons and learn for themselves or they will end up years behind later on in life.",

      "I think \"gifted\" out here still doesn't equal \"average.\" \nI moved here from CT and my son goes to Arapahoe HS. That's supposed to be the best of the bunch in Littleton, but I was shocked at how non-challenging it is. He has straight A's without even trying, and those are AP classes. It's an open campus, they all come and go as they please, many times, he'll just stay home and do his classes online, and he's lucky if he gets five hours of homework a month. Not to mention, only 160 days of school here.\nIn my old HS in CT, the students there still average 3-4 hours a night of homework, full days of classes, and 180 days of school. \nWhen we first moved back out here in 2015,  his 3rd grade curriculum was essentially the same as his first grade one in CT. Honestly, the schools are a joke out here, but when you're living in a state with the third lowest property taxes in the country, and the teachers here all have second and third jobs because they couldn't afford to live otherwise, it's kind of obvious why things are the way they are. I know property taxes have gone up because of revaluations, but I honestly laugh when people complain, because they're still ridiculously low. \nAs they say, you certainly get what you pay for."

The shortage of our housing also makes these big corporations shrug it off when they get called out.\n\nI moved out of Uptown Square in August 2023 and it took unit December to get my deposit back.

Go register yourself as an apprentice with DORA, and register with IEC (international electrical contractors). Once you have those two things done you should be able to get on with a electrical contractor pretty easy. And with no money out of your pocket. It's a solid trade with alot of avenues to pursue once your licensed. Just make sure you get on with a company that does at minimum commercial work, and if possible industrial.

You need to get an idea of how much power you actually use to properly size the system. Then actually do the math and see if it will save you money. As shitty as Xcel is, our rates are pretty reasonable. Unless you can pay cash on a system, interest rates are going to make solar a tough sell.

If kids dying on their bikes due to drivers not doing the bare minimum (in her case while driving a ducking dump truck) is a cost we‚Äôre going to accept to keep from holding drivers accountable enough to never let this happen then we should see the results of it in our faces constantly. Especially in this case.\n\nPeople should be terrified to cause a pedestrian to be killed. They should choose to be late for work before pulling through an intersection without checking the crosswalk and sidewalks etc.",
      "I've shown this to at least 40-50 other riders. Many were unaware of what a ghost bike is. Some were children. All seemed to take the memorial as a serious warning to other cyclists what can happen. If this was removed at the request of Alexis' husband, that's fine - he has to move on, and maybe it's too painful to see every day. I just hope it wasn't for some other reason or someone else felt that enough time had passed. Some of the paint we put in that area is still visible, so it's not all gone. I just don't want people to forget what happened there.",

I'm hopeful the city at least consulted with the family but they'd be completely in their rights just remove it.",

But make sure you have all your locate requests done and make sure they are up to date, they expire after a few weeks.  You'll have no gas for a few weeks but you'll get bumped closer to the top of the list.\n\nStart the paper work trail tomorrow morning and let the misery begin.  It'll take 2-3 weeks to get the \"paper work\" processed.  After that you'll get assigned an engineer.  The engineer is over loaded with work so you will be about 6-12 weeks out before your new gas line is designed.  And yeah since this is spring they are getting loads of work dumped on them.  Once it is designed it will go out to either xcel or one of their contractors.  Once it is in their que it'll be an additional 2-12 weeks before someone comes on over and moves your line.  The fees add up and since it isn't an emergency or something they screwed up it'll be about 2-10k to move it for you.  Oh and the road cut if they decide to do that will be another 3-5k.  Maybe hiring a real contractor would have saved you all this shit.   \n\nJust my experience numerous times.  You may have better results.",

But RTD should have bigger priorities. The light rail has been unusable for about 5 years now with unreliability due to operator shortages and constant maintenance projects that have zero regard for how they impact users. That impacts people's ability to live without a car substantially more because it deals with something you might need daily.\n\nBustang/pegasus/snowstang is improving and gets you to the mountains, and most mountain towns served have surprisingly good transit service so they can ferry tourists around once there. All can be improved in terms of frequency and reliability, but it's very usable and cheap. I think improving those services will do more than some pass that offers minimal savings.",

So there may be an audience for this. Is it enough to justify bus service? Maybe.\n\nOTOH, bussing people to any park is going to cause crowding issues, which are already a problem at most of them.

I support less cars within the metro area, but I‚Äôm always going to be avoiding people in the mountains and having a vehicle helps with that.",
      "This already exists though. There are RTD avd CDOT routes that provide access to all or most of these things. You can take them this week, not in a theoretical future. Why does it need to be in the form of a special pass? Just get a monthly.¬†",
      "If it works for you, great.\n\nIt won't work for me. I already live in the mountains, for one. For another, the roads up here are not really designed for RTD buses. The traffic up here is bad enough without having to follow a lumbering belching bus for 30 miles.",
      "Public transit is never really gonna work to service back country exploits like dispersed camping.",
      "No because the lines would close the day after I paid for the pass. I wouldn‚Äôt sign up for anything long term with RTD until they prove their reliability and sustainability¬†",
      "No",
      "Would never happen sadly. RTD doesn‚Äôt have enough drivers or security to keep most of their current trains safe. Let alone any new ones",
      "I absolutely would if it was reliable and actually had routes that were early enough. I love the bustang / Snowstang but leaving at 7 during peak traffic is annoying as hell. \n\nAlso, RTD is a dumpster fire that needs different management or should simply be made a public department instead of a private company. In its current state I wouldn‚Äôt trust RTD to show up at the trailhead to bring me home.",
      "[CDOT already does this](https://ridebustang.com/snowstang-mountain-service/). The service needs to be expanded to have more options than one morning and one evening bus on weekends.",
      "I don‚Äôt get why this is such a big thing. If you live in NYC and want to go camping and don‚Äôt have a car people will rent a car. In Denver I‚Äôve known people who didn‚Äôt have cars but their friends do or they rent them. It‚Äôs a difficult place not to have a car but not impossible if you aren‚Äôt in the suburbs. It‚Äôs more viable to be a one car household if you plan around it.",
      "RTD needs an overhaul. First, rename it DART. DENVER AREA RAPID TRANSIT. second, cage in all transit areas so you have to pay, have a pass, etc. to access the train. Third, make it super cheap so users can see the benefits and then slowly raise prices to make it functional. And lastly, always have a presence that deters unwanted travelers. Otherwise, it‚Äôs just a waste of resources and a place for undesirables to invade.",
      "As a vision impaired person who cannot drive, yes! As someone who regularly rides RTD and deals with trips that take triple or quadruple longer than in an auto, no!",
      "Well firstly the main issue I would have with a \"adventure pass is that it won't make the light rail an more appealing to ride, I ride it relatively frequently but as a full grown man I have been on the light rail and felt dangerous unsafe, and again I'm not a women, or someone who might get targeted. \n\nUnfortunately the problem lies that there aren't enough resources for there to be a proper security presence at any station, that isn't downtown, so the metal I'll and the drug addict use it as a way to get around town for free. \n\nNow I'm not saying that the homeless population shouldn't be able to use the light rail, most of the times the homeless on the train are harmless, but I've seen a woman who clearly had replaced here blood with meth scream an entire section of train down to a few people while holding onto a baggie that was clearly some drug. She actually ended up leaving it on the seat. I made sure it was disposed of properly. \n\nTLDR:  the RTD has several issues to resolve, personally I would like to feel safe using public transportation.",
      "Nope. RTD dropping unprepared people off into even mild backcountry is a complete disaster plan. How to create a disaster, anyway.",
      "Maybe? A lot would have to change. I make a sincere effort to take RTD when I can, but it seems like it's getting increasingly more difficult to get from \"regular\" point A to point B instead of the system improving--and I'm mostly just trying to get from southeast Denver to downtown or north/west suburbs and feeling challenged by that (fewer trains, buses that don't show up, no viable late-night options). RTD needs to keep working on its local day-to-day logistics and making that worthwhile first.",
      "RTD used to be pretty legit. When I was in high school 15 years ago, it was so much fun taking the bus from the suburbs into Denver with friends. I used to take RTD everywhere, including concerts. \n\nNow it just isn‚Äôt. The fentanyl/ opioid crisis has really exploded and no one really stops people from smoking hard drugs on the trains.",

Yes I still need a car to go skiing and hiking, and on some longer trips, but for work, and 60-70% of my daily travels I don‚Äôt need a car.

      "Denver isn't doomed to be forever car-centric because of the outdoors. Needing to drive to the mountains doesn't mean that you need to drive to the grocery store, the gym, or to work.\n\nIt just means that you need to drive to go to the mountains. \n\nAs someone that lived in Denver without a car for many years, the solution is to just rent a car or carpool with someone that does have a car. We don't need to spend $11k a year to own, maintain, insure, and operate a car because we go to the mountains on weekends. There are rental services that will drop a car off at your door and pick it up when you're done with it.",
      "LOL, RTD can't even get it right in the city. \n\nThe last thing we want is free RTD to the trail heads, since they don't enforce ticketing, so every crackhead in the area is there. \n\nAnd good luck getting home when you get back to the trailhead and RTD has decided to cancel. You better hope there is cell service available or you are in a very serious situation.",

      "Hiking - We could have buses to popular trailheads from Denver and Idaho springs.  \n  \n* The lowest hanging fruit is Echo lake, there is easily enough demand for it - run a bus to echo lake, then turn the Mt Blue Sky road into bus shuttle-only. Not only would that protect the natural environment and animals by getting rid of all the traffic, pollution, and parked cars littered at summit lake and Mt Blue Sky peak, but it would allow you to enjoy the scenery more when you aren't focused on the road, and it would allow for one-way hikes that cover more ground than out-and-back. Imagine hiking from Echo Lake to Mt Blue Sky peak and then taking the shuttle down. Getting to Mt Blue Sky peak is honestly a let down when you are greeted by idling SUVs parked all over the place. Charge for parking at Echo Lake to help fund these shuttles.  \n* Berthoud pass could work too - it's a busy trailhead with access to hikes in multiple directions on the continental divide trail  \n* This is already a thing in some places. Back in 2019 we took Amtrak to Glenwood springs for a long weekend, on one day we hiked hanging lake via the required shuttle, and another day we took the RFTA bus to Maroon bells which also had a required shuttle, then did a great hike there. Zion national park had a good bus shuttle system that was very frequent, private cars were generally banned from the canyon - and I was SO glad they were otherwise you'd be listening to revved engines the entire time while you were trying to enjoy your hike.  \n  \nSkiing - We already have Snowstang buses that work great for skiing - I take these to Loveland every year! And we have the winter park express train, which is also great but pricier. Just need to expand Snowstang, push more people onto it, and I think more expensive/limited parking at the resorts would help create more demand for it then we'd have better service.  \n  \nFor everything else - it's not that complicated, just rent a car. Either with a car share service or standard rental. [Colorado car share](https://carshare.org/vehicles-locations/) has lots of availability around downtown, Cap Hill, and Boulder, and limited availability elsewhere including Longmont, Breckenridge, Dillon, Nederland.",
      "If they could figure out a way to do the last mile to a trail head.or camping area then this would work great. \n\nI Invision something like a reservation system that you could sign up for before hand that would see something similar to an access a ride grab you from say the Pine Junction park and ride and then take you to the trail head you signed up for."

To answer your question, about $60k with no gc and all goes to plan.",
      "We were quoted 60k about 3 years ago.",

      "I finished my basement (1000sq ft) myself with only hiring out to finish the drywall at the height of the pandemic. This included a storage room, full bath, office, living room, and wet bar. I believe the total came out to around 20k.",

But I‚Äôm looking to do a bedroom (already have egress), an open living room, a small off office (no closet), and a basic bathroom.  I‚Äôve requested carpet and hollow core doors.  No more than just mdf baseboards and trim.  My cheapest quote was $75/sqft.  That‚Äôs from a group that came recommended from 3 of my neighbors who all used them in the pandemic and got wet bars and built-ins for $50k and nice flooring.  Pricing is over the top in Colorado, plain and simple.",

      "This is a complicated question that has no where near enough detail to be answered because it depends what you're doing. Are you looking for a per hour rate or overall for the project?\n\nAnother factor is, there's no \"one\" labor cost. For context, I'm finishing my basement right now. Labour involved:\n\nDemo some existing framing  \nNew Framing+Insulation  \nPlumbing, including ripping up and laying new concrete  \nElectric, ~ 30 lights, new sub panel, switches   \nDrywall  \nTexturing dry wall  \nBathroom tile install  \nLVP flooring install  \nPainting  \nCarpeting the stairs\n\nEveryone of these are different people that my GC has hired. Electric labour is way more $$$ than the guys painting.\n\nIn total I'm paying about 45k and it's 1000sqft, 2 rooms and a half bath. If you know your materials cost you can guesstimate the labour after assuming profit for the GC?",
      "Would love to come take a look and help you get an idea on costs. I do things like this for a living. Dm me if interested",

      "$6,250.00",

Pull a permit, hire unqualified labor, fail inspection, then pay for a GC to rip everything out and do it right.\n\nBut, don't worry, it's only your family's life, resale value, insurance coverage, law suits, and your neighbors at risk.\n\nSo, in short, somewhere between $200-$1M/sqft. If you can't afford a GC, you can't afford the lawyers you'll need.\n\nAlso, who are you going to call when laborers fuck things up, so that, you know, it gets fixed properly? You can't rely on shoddy plumbing to put out the electrical fire that sets your bedroom ablaze.\n\nIf you have to ask, you have no business doing it, and your insurance policy won't cover it, especially because you've publicly admitted to it here."

Worse, the leaves need to be wet so that the herbicide granules stick to the leaves - that's really hard to time in this arid environment. Even if you water first, in our low humidity things dry fast. \n\nSuch weed-n-feed mixes won't kill any weeds if applied this time of year. The fertilizer part is good, but the herbicide part may not help at all.\n\nLook for a pre-emergent mix. But really it is often best to just let the weeds sprout and then spray them. \n\n1: Fertilize and water and wait a few days after mowing before applying. That way the weeds have nice big leaves to absorb the herbicide and are metabolically active such that they'll move that herbicide down into the roots real fast like before the herbicide breaks down and becomes inactive. \n\n2: Don't mow for a few days after application. Don't water for at least a day after application. That allows the herbicide to be absorbed by the plant and gives it time to move throughout the plant, killing the whole things roots and all.",

I lived in one for a single year when I first moved here, rent went from 2200 to 2600 in just the one year when they asked if I wanted to renew and I said hell to the no. Private landlords don't tend to raise rent by as much in retrospect. Just food for thought",
      "Honestly, even with all the amenities in a ‚Äúluxury‚Äù apartment building, I (28) would much rather be saving some extra money. I‚Äôm moving from LoDo down to Englewood after 3 great years at my building. \n\nManagement changed to Griffis this year and I think now is the perfect time to try something new and save some money.\n\nWith that said, I‚Äôve lived in the same building for 3 years and have absolutely loved it. It‚Äôs safe, it‚Äôs clean, convenient for groceries and living is generally easy and issue-free, except the cost.",
      "&gt;Will I be able to justify spending upwards of 45% of my income on rent\n\nNo, and the apartment often will not even let you rent there unless that number is south of 33%.\n\nYou personally might be able to make the numbers work but it'll be tight (or impossible) when your rent goes up the next year and you're all of a sudden paying 50-55% of your income straight to them. \n\nGet a roommate or look at cheaper apartments.",
      "Before my husband and I bought our house in 2020, we lived in several of these ‚Äòluxury‚Äô apartment complexes and the consistent theme in all of them was that these nice amenities (like the pool/hot tub, gym equipment, appliances in the common areas) were almost consistently broken / out of order. \n\nAdditionally, most of these complexes charged us a separate utility bill for our share of those common areas that were often out of order, so it was extra annoying when they‚Äôd go unfixed for weeks or months. \n\nThere was not a strong sense of community in any of them - after about 5 years of living in these places I met a total of one person I still keep in touch with - and I say this as someone who frequently hosted events / spent time in those common areas. \n\nI suggest renting whatever makes the most sense financially."

A 15 year old is dead because they were in a stolen car. Teens are stealing cars on a regular basis thanks to social media and don‚Äôt give a damn about themselves or the person they stealing from.  \n\nMy car was stolen from the parking lot of the high school I work at. I‚Äôm lucky my car recovered quickly,  and wasn‚Äôt responsible for killing someone or having someone be killed in my car. But this is getting to the point where this story could have been any of us. It keeps happening. \n\nIn my case, APD has been able to identify the teen who stole my car but the teen has not been arrested and is still stealing cars around the city. I can‚Äôt help but wonder is this the same kid? Or is it another teen who also keeps getting away with stealing cars. All for what‚Ä¶a joy ride?\n\nThese stories are heartbreaking. Our kids are hurting‚Ä¶ which only adds to them acting out, our laws are a joke when it comes to car theft. You shouldn't be able to continue to commit crime after crime and get away with it. This is becoming common place and kids don‚Äôt get in trouble and the behavior escalates.  The cops are a joke. These kids can‚Äôt think about the consequences of their actions beforehand. What are we teaching this teens?\n\nWe talk about wanting reform but we are setting our kids up for failure. We don‚Äôt even have a program to help better kids after committing a crime‚Ä¶.most of them are shuffled in and out of schools, are disengaged in school and allowed to roam the halls of school and are still up to same behavior. Teens naturally believe they are invincible‚Ä¶. We‚Äôve all believed that about ourselves at one time. Add that to getting away with crime after crime I can only imagine a teen feels more embolden. \n\n I‚Äôm all about rehabilitation and reforming the criminal justice system, but we need accountability, we need common sense laws, and we also need to help these kids better their lives so they won‚Äôt continue the same behavior. \n\nAnd who gets stuck with the responsibility? The car owner. Insurance doesn‚Äôt give a damn. So many of us are working so hard and barely making ends meet and you wake up and your car is gone and you can‚Äôt get to work! The person who had their car stolen not only has to deal with feeling violated but now to know a crime occurred in their car. I‚Äôm sure the car insurance company will try and pay out as little as possible.\n\nI am tired of seeing the suffering. Our systems are so broken. I don‚Äôt know what to do anymore. \n\nA child is dead. Parents, family, and friends are now mourning. A friend is responsible for killing their friend. Im sure the schools are now working on the response...and I wonder what the ripple effect will be in the school/community. I can only imagine between the 5 teens‚Ä¶this death is one of many. This event should have NEVER occurred in the first plane. \n\nMayor Mike, APD, APS, CCSD, City of Aurora Government officials, residents of the Aurora Community‚Ä¶.what are we going to do fix this problem? I love my city. I want the best for all of the residents, life is hard enough for everyone at the moment, but we need some accountability and we need to take action.",

      "The continual raiding of the parks and rec budget is really disappointing. Yeah, they‚Äôre flowers. But our park system has an enormous impact on quality of life and mental/physical health. They‚Äôve slashed rec center hours, reduced path snow plowing, and now this. \n\nI‚Äôm all for helping these folks out, but this is going to bite them in the ass. Because people will notice when the flowers are gone.",
      "Bro how much money is in the flower bed funds lol",
      "The Parks Department is partnering with some local native-plant organizations on a pilot program to convert many of these beds to native xeric perennials. Be nice to Parks and Rec; they're going through some really tough stuff right now.\n\nAlso, please don't guerrilla garden in these areas unless you really know what you're doing and are getting a wink and a nod from Parks. There are a lot of seed mixes online that have non-native or even invasive species.",

      "The rec centers aren‚Äôt open either on Sundays etc etc\nWhy would we pay to put them up in hotels for 3 months to then put them on the streets? What a waste of $ \nDenver would not pay for a hotel for 3 months for our own citizens - if an abused wife and kids move to co from another state or in state we would never put them up for 3 months while they got situated. Lets treat everyone equally and not play favorites to ‚Äúnewcomers‚Äù",
      "Maybe they should landscape with native species that look great but don‚Äôt need much tending to. Make the most of the situation.",
      "That‚Äôs messed up. A bunch of horticulturists get canned and the public spaces they beautiful go fallow. And why?",
      "I think it‚Äôs pretty clear that no other towns or states will help with the migrants at this point. Proud of the city but our government can‚Äôt solo manage a crisis",
      "Sounds like a great opportunity to replace flowerbeds with native plants that need very little maintenance",
      "Man I‚Äôm gonna miss the flowers we really need to get some federal assistance for immigrants",
      "Immigration reform is the only answer.  My husband is an immigrant (now citizen) and the immigration process was a nightmare.  I can‚Äôt fathom going through that process with the barriers that they have.  Extend immediate temporary work visas for a 12 month period to those with legitimate refugee status.  Allow them to work for a year and re-evaluate their contributions.  Extend very temporary necessities (food, shelter, clothes, hygiene) for the first 2 weeks while they get their first paychecks.  Suddenly you will see the crisis correct as migrants will work/pay taxes and be required to contribute to society.  You will see less concentration of migrants in expensive cities like Denver as they will want to work in affordable areas.  Rural areas will become more populated and successful as laborers contribute.  Yes, we need to stop excessive spending but that is only occurring because we have individuals who are literally dependent on it right now due to their literal inability to work.  They are here and not likely going anywhere else so let them work as soon as possible.",

      "Take it out of the police budget.  They can go play candy crush on their own dime.",
      "Ok, I am all for equal upward mobility to all citizens and migrants. But this has gone too far! WTF?!",
      "Why don‚Äôt the police ever get any funding diverted? Surely there is some money that they‚Äôre not using",

      "I signed up!  It‚Äôs super easy.  When you plug in, they text you the schedule your car will be charging on.  It almost always has my car charging during off-peak times (mostly overnight, and ready to drive by 6am).  If you don‚Äôt like the times that xcel chooses, you text back override and charging starts immediately.  I think you need to use their schedule 75% of the time or something like that, but I can probably count on two hands the number of times I have overridden the times they picked (I‚Äôve been enrolled for 2.5 years) so that has never been an issue for me.  You get a signup bonus and then I think $50 or $100 for every year you stay enrolled.\n\nAlso, another poster mentioned having to use an app to charge - not sure what infrastructure they are using but that‚Äôs never been anything I have used.  I have a ChargePoint Flex and just plug in/out, no app required (though I guess you use the app once to initially set it up - but that‚Äôs the case for any L2 connected home charger).",
      "I looked into this program when I bought my EV last year.  I opted not to do it because in my opinion, the control you are giving up on your electricity use is not worth the $100 gift card. \n\nThis program essentially gives Xcel the right to control when you charge your EV.  In other words, they can stop it at any time.  Yes, you can override it, but that required multiple steps and if you override too many times, you will likely be disqualified from the program.  It also requires use of an app to charge your EV at home.  Maybe my elder millennial mindset is influencing me on this, but I think it is entirely ridiculous that I need to use an app to charge my EV at home.\n\nI program my EV to only charge during Xcel's TOU off-peak hours.  But I can easily override that through my car if I for some reason need to charge my EV during other hours.  That is enough for me, I am paying the lowest rates without giving Xcel any control, which I value.  Looking through this program, the charging times can vary so much, I think it would make it hard to plan around that.  I also use my EV a lot - on the scale of 16,000/miles year and need to charge it reliability for that level of use. \n\nIf you don't intend to use your EV as much as I do or have no problem giving up control on your charging schedule, then go for this.  If you value control over $100/year, then stay away.",
      "I would sign up for the $50 annual discount program if I had seen it before buying my charger. I ended up buying an unsupported charger before realizing the program existed. \n\nIt‚Äôs not worth buying a new charger for.",
      "I participate.  Xcel has only once restricted charging which occurred last summer on a hot afternoon day.  They had proactively emailed that it could occur which made it easy to avoid charging during that time.  Definitely worth doing it for the cash."

      "I'm pretty agnostic towards charter schools in Colorado one way or another, but there's a ton of misinformation in these replies.  Charter schools operate differently in each state, and the national conversation has often overshadowed the reality in Colorado. A few things to clarify.\n\nCharter schools in Colorado are *not* for profit, they legally required to be non-profit entities.  This is much different than, say, the Michigan charter school model which has garnered a lot of attention over the years because of people like Betsy DeVos.\n\nCharter schools are regulated by state \"charter\" (hence the name).  DPS is tasked with administering them in the Denver area, but they have to follow state guidelines for approving/denying charter guidelines.\n\nCharter schools, in many ways, have more oversight from a performance standpoint.  They face more regular check-ins, and are more likely to be shut down than your standard district run school.\n\nCharter schools cannot legally discriminate against students on the basis of special education needs, academic ability, race, etc. \n\nThe purpose of a charter school is to have more flexibility in curriculum and school structure/operations as they do not have to follow specific district guidelines.  More school options, in general, I would say is a good thing.  But it always depends on how it is executed. Depending on your feelings towards teachers unions, the lack of union could be considered a pro or a con, but charter schools also often follow union comp structures to stay competitive for hiring.\n\nMany of the best performing schools, even for minority populations, are charter schools.  So are some of the worst performing.\n\nThe education system in general is broken, the education system in Colorado is worse than average largely because of a lack of funding.  Charter schools are not to blame for the funding issue, though, there simply is not enough money to go around.",

It looks like it is possible to take the W train from Union Station to the Federal Center stop and then walk a mile to the building I am heading to.

      "# Lava lamps, specialty lighting and ambiance in and around Denver?\n\nI've seen some great places like Aspen Lodge with their year round Christmas and probably 30+ lava lamp setups. What other places sport a funky vibe like this?\n\nBetter yet, where can I find a variety of lava lamps to purchase like 52oz and Grande models other than a Spencers? Spotted a record store in grand junction with them all but loool that's quite the drive.\n\nBeyond all that, I know Denver has a deep history in neon signage. Are there any other places that really kick off a neon vibe like bonnie brae versus the more laid back lava lamp vibe mentioned?\n\nThanks.",

Evans Ave. As the bus approached the intersection at Colorado Blvd, a driver cut over from the lane to the left so he could make a right turn. The bus had no time or space to stop and crashed into the car. Fortunately, no one on the bus was hurt.",
      "Former bus driver here, and current RTD employee. If you cut off a bus you not only risk having your own car destroyed, but there may be 30 or more people on board that bus who are at risk of serious injury if the operator has to slam on the brakes. \n\nAnother tip: if you ever need to turn right in front of a stopped bus (at a coach stop), approach slowly and tap your horn gently to get the operators attention.

The bus drivers that stay on time are the ones that assert their right of way and don't care about getting in the way of car drivers.  \n  \nThe buses are carrying far more people more efficiently than your single occupancy vehicle. And if they are a little late, it could mean someone misses their transfer and becomes 15-30 minutes late to where they are going. Give them priority!",

      "Former Bus Operator Here:\n\nBusses are universally hated by drivers. They're slow, they're big, and they stop frequently. Drivers temporarily lose their senses around Buses and will attempt any number of insane maneuvers in order to get to where *they* want to go. \n\n* The bus is at a stop, and the stop is near-side of the intersection (as opposed to the other, far-side of the intersection). There is a car that wishes to make a right hand turn at the intersection and instead of waiting for the bus to move they decide they will shoot around the bus, dive into its lane, and then make their turn. \n* The bus is traveling down the highway in the right lane. The interstate coaches can only do 70 mph with a tailwind, downhill, on a Tuesday but the onboard systems will record excessive speeding over 65mph so there's no reason for the bus to ever leave the right lane. There is a car behind the bus that wishes to use the upcoming off-ramp, but instead of waiting for the bus to travel towards and past it the car decides to pass on the left doing 20mph over the speed limit, dive into the lane ahead of the bus, and then barely makes the off-ramp it almost missed. \n* There is road construction on a city street and the bus's lane is closing in a couple hundred feet. All traffic in this lane is merging left. There is a pickup truck beside the bus making a concerted effort to continuously close the gap between themselves and the SUV ahead of them, the gap into which the bus has to merge. The pickup driver, sitting at eye level with the bus operator, is making a very concerted effort to look as cool as a cucumber and wants to appear oblivious to the fact that they are being a massive dick to 40+ people staring at them through a window. \n* Car dives in front of bus on a city street after perceived slight. In a display of road rage they brake check the bus. It just so happened that RTD Transit Police (the real Police, not the security) were doing a ride along with Aurora PD. The Driver of the Bus immediately opened the front doors as the LEO's jumped up, and watched with glee as four armed officers ran out and surrounded the vehicle.

An empty semi with a trailer is 30,000 pounds give or take and will often be loaded with another 30-60 thousand pounds. Most sedans are about 3-4,000 pounds.

      "You do have rights as renters. We ran into a similar issue as renters and got legal consultation and they helped us get reimbursed based on the[Warranty of Habitability](https://coloradohousingconnects.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/AHC-FL-HABITABILITY-21-02-05-V11-1.pdf). It is specific legislation put in place to protect renters and hold landlords liable if the space is deemed uninhabitable. \n\nIt sounds like they have responded to the problem and the $100 a night might cover them legally in this instance, but it would still be worth looking into to see if you can get further compensation or accommodations. Landlords and management companies are legally liable for their tenants if there are issues (that started outside of the renter‚Äôs control or fault) that make housing uninhabitable. Every situation is different so I‚Äôd definitely start keeping a paper trail of any and all communications and looking into specifically that Warranty of Habitability, it is ultimately what protects you and the other tenants in a situation like this. \n\nIf things get progressively worse or management is uncommunicative or not resolving the issue in a timely manner, I‚Äôd even suggest googling and reaching out to landlord/tenant lawyers in the area for consultations. \n\nIn our situation, we didn‚Äôt even have to ‚Äúhire‚Äù a lawyer. All it took was one consultation with a flat fee (I think it was like $100 or something but worth it in the end). We brought them all the information and they looked through our situation and helped us push back on our management who ultimately stepped down from the situation and compensated us. Tenants have more rights than people think, especially in a progressive city like Denver. It‚Äôs definitely worth it to look into your rights in relation to your situation. Good luck and I hope your situation is resolved soon!",
      "Try reaching out to the health department.¬†",
      "&gt; Do we have any legal rights at this point as renters or are we SOL.\n\nIt sounds like this isn't the kind of problem legal rights can solve. A lawsuit against the landlord isn't going to make the plumbers work any faster. Do you have any reason to believe that the plumbers are slacking off? \n\nFWIW, your renter's insurance may provide a payment for a hotel, too. Add that to what the landlord is paying out and you - and the elderly neighbors - might be able to afford help moving into a hotel. If they really thought it could be fixed this week, then it must not be the kind of thing my building has where things are gonna be fucked up for months. So odds are you won't be in a hotel any longer than a week.",
      "Your management has provided reasonable accommodation to fulfill your rights of habitability. If you don‚Äôt consider that satisfactory, then you‚Äôll have to sue them."

      "I've never heard anyone say anything bad about The Colorado Sun. But the great thing is you don't have to trust anyone else's opinion. You can read every article for free, and subscribe only if you like what you see.\n\nAlso, unlike probably every other news source you read, the Sun is a 501(c)3 nonprofit organization.",
      "The Colorado Sun is really fucking good. When the Denver Post was bought out ~5 years ago, all of the older, established (competent) writers and editors left and founded the Sun.\n\nThe Sun is the best local/regional paper in CO, imo.",
      "They're solid, fact based, reporting. They do great work, and we're lucky to have them.",
      "The Sun is staffed by reporters who were let go from the Post. They‚Äôre solid journalists- the real kind, not glorified content creators.",
      "I‚Äôm a big fan, LOL! (Also hi, my name is Eric and I‚Äôm one of the 10 journalists who cofounded The Sun).\n\nI have to say the comments on here are warming my heart because we really are just a bunch of journalists who want to give the whole state the journalism it deserves. From jump we‚Äôve made sure we did not hide our news behind a paywall because we believe that we have to earn your monetary support, not trick you into it by hiding news from people who need it.\n\nAnd re: the ease of cancelling your membership, I‚Äôm literally the guy who actually configures everything about refund periods, cancellation and upgrades in our system and I can say with confidence that we have some of the loosest, easiest to use settings in the business. (I‚Äôve seen the options available for subscriptions like this and they can be extremely shady and hard to use.) And if anyone has a problem, we handle all customer service in house with our actual employees who are empowered to help everyone who reaches out (instead of following some corporate policy to stretch everything out). \n\nSo if you‚Äôre interested in supporting us, just head to [coloradosun.com/join](https://coloradosun.com/join) and become a member. I really love the member-exclusive newsletters we offer (Colorado Sunday at the $10/month level and a whole slate of topical weeklies at the $20/month level, including The Temperature, our climate and health newsletter). But literally any level genuinely makes a huge difference in how ambitious we‚Äôre able to be with our reporting.\n\nIt‚Äôs the best bang for your buck on journalism in the state, if I do say so myself. Shoot me an email at eric@coloradosun.com if you have any other questions or ping me here! Thanks for considering us!",
      "I love the Sun. Actual journalism, not clickbait. They deserve a few bucks, if you have it.",
      "It‚Äôs the best publication in the state.",
      "It‚Äôs a really good organization - the only Colorado news source I subscribe to.",
      "Love the Sun.",
      "Good stuff. Much better than local papers",
      "I like Colorado Sun, CPR, and Denverite.",
      "Absolutely adore The Sun. Their daily email with new articles is the greatest. Especially love Jason Blevins' The Outsider.",
      "Its superb. Absolutely worth paying for.",
      "I don't live in Colorado anymore, but I will still go out of my way to read the Sun. Legit journalism.",
      "I‚Äôm a big fan! Their reporting is solid and they also seem to host a good number of events and round table discussions about local issues. I watched one on housing and thought it was pretty good. I‚Äôve¬†been a subscriber for a few years and haven‚Äôt had any issues with their billing. Yeah for local news!",
      "The Colorado Sun is good.  I unfortunately struggle to read it frequently, but I've been a financial supporter to it for many years.",
      "They are the best. Like literally amazing",
      "They‚Äôre the best!",
      "In the sorry state of journalism, The Colorado Sun is a true bright spot of real reporting.\n\nIs it perfect or even what they would like if money was no object? No. I don't think they would claim it that it was. But it is the best Denver has to offer. Given that I think most everybody agree it would be even better with more support,  Which is a  good reason to support them.",
      "I paid for a year and was only charged for a year.  That was three years ago.  I'm going to re-up soon because I like their mostly unbiased reporting.  The editorials are as can be expected though, but hey they can't make me read those.",
      "Former journalist (newspaper, digital side of TV) here. The Colorado Sun is one of the top-notch go-to sites for informative news. Excellent writing. They dive into serious topics and don't do ambulance chasing/click bait like the TV station websites \\*cough\\* \\*Fox31\\* \\*cough\\*",
      "Colorado Sun appears to operate under the same model as Defector, Aftermath, and (to a lesser extent) Substack.\n\nPay for journalism - stop expecting it to be free.\n\nThe \"Gazettes\" (Denver, CS, etc.) are owned by the Anschutz' and are right-wing leaning and/or propaganda purporting to be \"true news\".",
      "The sun and Colorado newsline are great",
      "Everyone in here talking about the Sun‚Äôs journalism but it sounds like OP was specifically asking about their subscription model and billing practices. \n\nI‚Äôm glad to hear the Sun is so good though! Sounds like I need to read them more often.",
      "The Colorado Sun is the best news outlet in Colorado. They were founded by a bunch of journalists who were fired by the Denver Post when they were sold. Can‚Äôt recommend them enough.",
      "I agree with most of the comments. They are great, but they aren‚Äôt perfect. They do have some opinion that they pass off as reporting and some slanted / sensationalized stuff. They lean left, so we (especially we as a sub) tend to give them a pass. Still best local news I‚Äôve found.",
      "What can I say that hasn't already been said? The Sun is hands down my favorite news outlet. I regularly see their articles in this sub and I've learned A LOT from their content, even in the dialogues about the topic. Guaranteed, without the Sun I would be half as informed as I am now.",
      "I like westword, it‚Äôs free and it‚Äôs great",

Bill was back to normal the following month.",

Next month, normal water bill.",

      "My HOA got hit with a $36k dollar bill a few months ago. Said it was for a faulty meter that had apparently been under reporting for 6 years. (So much bullshit in this statement)\n\nWe disputed the charge with the water board stating it was their fault for having let it go on so long if they could in fact come up with a timeline for how much to charge us (I don't believe it either way) \n\nAbout a month later we got a response that the charge had been reversed and they only wanted $2k. \n\nI would talk to your landlord and perhaps help him navigate the issue with the water board.",
      "Denver water once charged us for a swimming pool's worth of water. We don't have a pool.  We weren't even using our sprinklers. We protested. They did a meter calibration and found no issues.  We asked what our options were moving forward. They told us we had to pay the bill in full. They followed up with a shutoff notice.  How many of us have had the same experience?",
      "22k gallons over 30 days is 800 gallons / day. That's a lot, but not super crazy. If you had a continuously running toilet (flapper leak) that was responsible for all of it, that'd be 33 gal / hour, or a half-gallon a minute. For reference, a wide open faucet is 2 gallons \\_per minute\\_.",

      "Someone similar happened at our house, the bill was $350/mo! The city came out and found a burst pipe in the water main from the city. They were planning on changing over to copper(?) pipes in the future, but did the upgrade that day instead. I'm not sure if checking the water meter would catch this, but maybe share my story and ask if that's a possible cause?",
      "They don't measure the meter every month. Some months it is just an estimate and the reconsile later. It may be a leak that didn't get measured and the total was over 3 months or something.",
      "It‚Äôs simple:\n\nCall Denver water confirm they weren‚Äôt running average bills and this one wasn‚Äôt a catch up.\n\nHave them check meter and confirm no leaks, sounds like you did that.\n\nThen, determine which of your neighbors is lying about traveling and instead had a bunch of visitors over, or isn‚Äôt willing to own up that they left a faucet one while being gone for a week.  \n\nA typical 2 bedroom apartment uses close to 5k gallons a month.  We have no idea how many residents or visitors you guys have over this time period.",
      "The higher end of water use is like 100 ga/person/day...  Our duplex neighbors with whom we share a water bill (we have secondary private meters so we can divide usage) use regularly 15k/mo with 4 adults living there - we think they shower A LOT. We use like 3k with 2 adults but are total misers.\n\nSo 22k gallons is like 7 high-ish use people. It's not bonkers for a triplex. But it's indeed probably, as said, leaky toilet or faucet, adds up quick.",

      "The average person uses 4k gallons of water per month. You're already over half way there even if you only have one person per unit. What's the average usage over the last 12 months?

      "  \nHad this happen, the meter increased the water bill by \\~100 gallons a day. I.e. today said 100 gallons of use the next day went to 200 gallons (for that next day). Water company had to come out and replace the meter. Was a big PITA to get them to do that.",
      "I install smart water valves in peoples homes all the time. The primary reason for this is so if there is a water leak the valve will shut off! One of the features however of the valve is that it also tracks how many gallons a day run through these homes! What I have found is that the average daily use of water in a home is around 250gals so your report aligns with this and doesn‚Äôt seem to far fetched. You might want to bring this up to your landlord and push for them to install one, that way you could compare what the valve shows to what you‚Äôre being billed.",

      "Not sure who your water provider is, but some of them offer online services that show charts of when the water is being used, on like an hourly basis. If the usage is steady, similar rate each hour, it‚Äôs definitely a leak or a running toilet. Check the crawl space for leaks if you haven‚Äôt. Also your yard for big wet spots.",
      "This is likely not your issue since it's winter and I'm assuming if you have a swamp cooler,  it's winterized.  But, when we had a random massive water bill we asked our neighbors if perhaps their toilet was running (we live in a duplex style place) and determined that wasn't the issue.  Turns out our swamp cooler had a leak that we didn't realize was happening and promptly got it fixed.  \n\nJust thought I'd throw that out there as something to potentially consider in trying to figure it out.

Since you have a minimal understanding of the game it could be an option for you as a good amount of people up there will not be super focused on the game. That said, anyone can walk around the Rooftop and check it out so you can go see it regardless of what ticket you buy. \n\nPersonally, I like sections 214 through 227 along the first base side. Good views of the game and you're high enough up that in between pitches you can take in views of the mountains. \n\nIf you are a meat eater, be sure to get a sausage from Biker Jim's while you're at the game."

      "If you drop GoG, that‚Äôs very doable",
      "Go to roxborough park instead of garden of the gods. Similar terrain, much closer to Denver.",
      "Three are real close, GG is the outlier. Add 6 hours to your tour should you go South.",
      "Coors tours require reservations.",
      "Same as what others have said, all are close except GotG.  Here are some alternatives:\n\n\\- **Roxborough State Park:** Very similar formations to GotG... some (like me) would actually say better.  Less crowds, much closer, about 30 mins south of the other attractions.\n\n\\- **Flatirons/Boulder:** Nothing like GotG, but worth seeing.  Scenic 40min-ish drive north up Highway 93 from the other attractions.  You can hit Eldorado Canyon State Park on the way, then hike the Flatirons at Chautauqua Park if you want (or just look at em).  Bonus is you get to check out Boulder too for a change of pace from the nature.\n\nI highly recommend the Boulder route.  You will see similar formations to GotG and Roxborough at Red Rocks.  Spending the morning at those Golden/Morrison attractions and the afternoon in Boulder sounds like a lovely day  \n\n\nEdit: also, I would consider driving up Lookout Mountain for the view rather than hiking.  There is better hiking at Eldorado Canyon, Chautauqua, and elsewhere imo",
      "Yes minus the garden of gods trip, skip colo springs altogether imo",
      "Agree with everyone else on Garden of Gods, but I want to add, I would skip the Coors brewery. Tour is self guided audio, you dont really get to do anything. If you have more than one day, I would book the tour at New Belgium Brewery in Fort Collins. Much more fun, you get more beer in total, but that is a full day activity on its own.",
      "If you drop garden of the gods, yes.",
      "Better question: is this even an enjoyable itinerary? Why not just limit the activities so that you can actually be in the moment and enjoy them?",
      "Drop GOG and then only if you plan to spend about 15 minutes at each location.",
      "Garden of Gods is an outlier, 90 minutes to south depending on traffic.\n\nA day trip to Colorado Springs is worthwhile. You could drive up Pikes Peak (very limited winter hours), GOG, and new Olympics Museum (gearing up for Paris 2024).",
      "Garden of the Gods is a different direction. You *could* do all in one day, but your visits would have to be short.\n\nGarden of the Gods is spectacular, though.",
      "Ditch garden of the gods that alone will take you like 5 or 6 hours including the drive",
      "Totally of you start off early enough.\n\nStart at GotG 5 or 6 am, \n\nthen head up to red rocks, about 1:30-2hr a drive, depending on traffic, take 470\n\nThen dinosaur ridge, \n\nthen lookout Mt. \n\nFuck coors, which closes at 4pm, unless you have a hard on for copper.\n\nInstead, stop off at Golden City Brewery or New Terrain Brewing Company.",
      "Shoot for the moon OP",
      "Definitely doable, but it's just a big day. Getting to GotG and back is about 3h.\n\nWake up at 6, down there, hang out for an hour come back, at red rocks by 10 (assuming you spend an hour at GotG)\n\nMy latest red rocks 4.5 mile hike took 1h 45mins. You're at 12, hit the ridge for 2h, 2pm, hit lookout mountain real quick, 3pm, do a Coors tour at 4pm, maybe hit a bar in between, now it's 6pm. Grab dinner in golden, you'll be starving.\n\nThat being said... I'd sleep in and go to flatirons which is much easier to get to and ease up the schedule.",
      "So if you need to do GoG I would say like the other redditors start that one first. But I don't fully understand the order of some of the others. Instead of going back and forth why not do a good loop. \n \nI would start with GoG \nThen I would go like this. \n\nRed rocks, \n\nDinosaur ridge (they are next to each other, and there is a nice hike at the ridge.)\n\nThen take rooney road to Colfax and go up the south side of lookout, and come back down via windy saddle and 19th \n\nAfter that, Coors is basically just down the road from 19th (you will have to take a left turn, but that's about it. Then afterwards you are next to the highway so that you can get back home. \n\nThis way, you are not going back and forth and wasting precious time. \n\nWhile I haven't gone as far as GoG in a single day, I did do the rest while biking, and it only took me a few hours (about six if I'm am counting the time to chill at each spot.) This would be the way I took on a bike. All in all they are pretty beautiful and worth a day by themselves in a way but with time that would be how I would plan it.",
      "Garden of the Gods and Red Rocks are basically the same thing. Drop that one and you're golden (pun intended). \n\nAlso, Lookout is cool but nothing too special other than the city view. Eldorado Canyon 15 miles North  is cooler for a short hike.",
      "Get rid of Garden of the Gods. Or, even better, skip the others and just do GOG imo. It's prettier and way cooler than all the other stuff you mentioned. You can stop by the fun penny arcade and grab some beer in Manitou Springs after too.",
      "If you drive just a few miles west on i70 past Genesee from the lookout mountain exit there is a buffalo herd overlook that's kinda neat if you're inclined.",
      "Garden of the Gods should be a standalone day trip by itself.  Everything else can be done in a day.",
      "Everyone is saying in this thread to drop GoG. Totally fair point but I think you might actually have to take out coors if you haven‚Äôt already gotten reservations",
      "It sounds a bit excessive to me. I would do the top 4, then do Garden of the Gods on a second day, and maybe add something more south to that",
      "Make sure to take the guided shuttle tour at Dinosaur Ridge otherwise walking up the ridge will take a lot of your time.",
      "GoG is far away.\n\nYou can do the whole list but it's a sunrise to sunset thing.\n\nSkip GoG and it's a comfortable easy day.",
      "But why? Cramming all of that into one day seems like a recipe for stress and exhaustion. Personally I‚Äôd space them out between days so that I could enjoy these attractions, rather than spend the day stressed, tired, and waiting to go home. \n\nUnless you‚Äôre a tourist who is here for a few days. That‚Äôs just poorly planned and you‚Äôre going to have to sacrifice GoG, which is a shame.",
      "But why? Will you remember what was where at that pace? GoG is not close at all. Awesome, but NOT worth the stress level. The only way I would attempt this is to stay in Colorado Springs the night before so that you‚Äôre only doing that drive once in the day. Denver &gt;CS &gt; Denver is not scenic.\n\nCoors is boring. If you‚Äôve been to a brewery, that‚Äôs the concept but on a Really Big Scale.",
      "I would do Red Rocks, Dino Ridge, Coors and Lookout Mountain see the lights at night) then GoG the next day.",
      "Garden of the gods would be a struggle. The time commitment to get down there vs what it actually is, isn't all that worth it in my opinion. \n\nIf you're really dying to see it, I'd lean towards doing that first to kill time in the morning with early start, then red rocks (closes at I don't remember what time if there's a concert that night), then dinosaur and lookout, last coors.",
      "Garden of the Gods is pushing it - but the rest is a fun day and could be managed.",
      "You could do the first 4 on a bike in one day",
      "Are you planning to look then leave? This is aggressive if you want to spend time in these places. It‚Äôs possible though.",
      "Echoing what others have said - swap out Garden of the Gods for Roxborough State Park, and it's doable in a day. Same geography, closer to Denver, smaller park, not nearly as paved over (most of GoG is walking on sidewalks), and **much** less crowded than GoG.",
      "No. Not with GoG",
      "the first 4 are 15 minutes drive apart, Garden of the Gods is \\~2hr drive south of Denver (depending on traffic)",
      "If you‚Äôre not used to the altitude and you hike at some of these locations you might be too tired to do the rest. Also Coors brewery tours end early so make sure you time that right.",
      "I feel like you could. I‚Äôd knock Garden of the Gods out first because everything else is in the same general area compared to it.",
      "Wait they brought back the brewery tour?",
      "Surprised no one mentioned the recent mc rider who hit most of this list in appprox 3 hours.",
      "No, but there's plenty of stuff to do in and around the Springs, to make a second trip worthwhile.\n\n[The Cog railway ](https://www.cograilway.com/)\n\n[The Western museum of mining &amp; industry ](https://wmmi.org/)\n\n[The Pikes peak Trolley museum ](https://coloradospringstrolleys.com/)\n\n[This guy](https://www.roadsideamerica.com/tip/37384)\n\n[The Manitou Springs cliff dwellings](https://www.cliffdwellingsmuseum.com/) (among many other natural wonders)\n\nAnd, if you feel like taking the hour detour to Ca√±on City, you could also check out the [Royal Gorge RR](https://www.royalgorgeroute.com/) &amp; [Bridge ](https://royalgorgebridge.com/) and/ or [the Colorado Prison museum ](https://prisonmuseum.org/), which is housed in the state penitentiary, and is the only prison museum (at least in the US) that's located in a functioning prison.",
      "Definitely not.",
      "You can do the short tour of Coors and just go to the bar. Personally, I would find a smaller brewery or distillery to tour and skip Coors.",
      "Ya the one stop on your list that would be difficult to due in one day would be, garden of the gods, all the other locations are relatively close, you would be driving up and down the foothills all day. \n\nAsking with friends and family, it seems to be a consensus that you should spread this out so you have time to enjoy each location.",
      "Don't listen to the naysayers - if you hit GOTG as the sun comes up, Red Rocks, Dinosaur Ridge, the Brewery, and Lookout Mountain are all within about 30 minutes (total) of driving distance between each other.\n\nNow that we're in MDT, if you make it to the Golden area by noon, you could do all of that stuff before the sun sets - give or take when the brewery is running tours. Book a room in Golden (or an AirBnB) and you can wrap up the evening on Washington Ave and the side streets.\n\nIf you want to spend a lot of time enjoying all of it, split GotG to a second day - and add Bishop Castle or the Dunes to the front or back end of it.",
      "Red rocks would be best to do in the morning hours. I think before noon it‚Äôs open to the public?\n\nThey then block it off to prepare for the evenings concert or event",
      "Got to schedule @ Coors now",

Denver Health felt much more down to earth. I also really like working with our patient population. We see crazy things, the staff mostly all want to be there in particular because they believe in health care for all. We have a robust education program so lots of med students/interns/residents and nursing students. There's plusses and minuses to that of course, but it means everyone is used to teaching and supporting learning and advancing careers. The cafeteria at UCHealth is better though.",
      "Denver Health is the original ‚Äúgeneral‚Äù hospital for Denver. It serves a large homeless, migrant and uninsured population. You are guaranteed to see a lot of different diagnoses there.",
      "A friend of ours is a doctor for UCHealth, and she had a baby a few years back. I was floored when she told us that the multi-billion dollar a year healthcare company did not offer any paid maternity leave. She instead had to use her own short-term disability insurance for that (at 70% of her usual salary). And because the insurance benefits are tied to recent income, she had to continue working full-time right up to her due date.\n\nAnother UCHealth story: a few years back, I needed to have minor surgery (pilonidal cyst excision). I informed the surgeon, the anesthesiologist, and 4 nurses that I was a recovering alcoholic and addict and didn't want to be prescribed any narcotic pain killers post-op. While I was still in post-op recovery, the surgeon wrote a prescription for oxycodone and sent my family member to go fill the prescription.\n\nFuck UCHealth.",
      "SCL recently merged with Intermountain, and Centura recently divorced into adventhealth and common spirit - so there are tons of changes happening at hospitals in the area.",
      "So, I work for UCHealth currently and I do not recommend. They treat their clinical staff like factory workers. Patient ratios keep going up,  but management still wants to meet the same care metrics, sorry folks but that‚Äôs not how it works. They make there staff in Denver either pay for parking or ride a shuttle in, which means if I work at 7 I actually need to be to work at 6:30, so they waste an extra hour of their employees day everyday‚Ä¶ You could park in the garage on campus, but it‚Äôs nearly always full Anna costs money. It is 100% obvious every decision this place makes is based on money and not care. Every three years we have to ‚Äútighten the budget,‚Äù because they need to bring spending down. Like maybe you guys should hire some better accountants so we‚Äôre not in a cash crunch every three years‚Ä¶ there is zero money put in infrastructure at this place. We keep coming up with millions to buy hospital systems, but our tech/building infrastructure is shit. They miss mash different systems from different health systems and wonder why nothing works‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs because all this crap was never designed to work together geniuses‚Ä¶ seriously stay away, I don‚Äôt recommend, it really gets old continually hearing about budget and money from this place.",
      "I think it depends on what you‚Äôre actually doing. \n\nIf you want to be a research assistant or something, CU and Denver Health are probably your major targets.  The CU med students and residents rotate at both hospitals.  Lots of teaching. DH is a safety net system and UCH is a tertiary academic system so they have different patient populations.  If you speak Spanish DH will probably snap you up. \n\nIf you‚Äôre looking to scribe or be an MA or something,  you can also look at HCA, Intermountain/SCL, and the former Centura hospital systems. Colorado Retina is a big private ophtho practice in the area as well.",

I even live and work walking distance to a train that I could never use for a commute because it runs too infrequently. It's a shame.",
      "Decisions like these are part of the reason everyone is calling for RTD board reform.\n\nAs of right now, 9 out of 15 representatives (specifically for districts B, C, D, E, F, I, J, L, and M) ran entirely unopposed. Which means, the majority of the RTD board was elected simply because they showed up and no one else did. There's no guarantee that these individuals are even remotely qualified for their roles outside of filling out paperwork to get one ballot or running a write-in campaign as there was no one to challenge them and ensure the best candidate wins.\n\nIn other words, almost two thirds of the people running RTD only have their roles because they were the only option or they got ~2000 people to write in their name, not because they proved they have understanding of transit, public enterprises, or what their city actually needs.",

They scaled back those reductions before Tuesday night‚Äôs vote, **which approved service going through about midnight Sunday through Thursday for the D, E, H, R and W lines, with service until about 2 a.m. on Fridays and Saturdays for all but the R-Line**.\n\nI'm just glad they walked back that BS plan to stop the trains so early at night. That was a giant f*ck you to anyone who works evening shifts.",

There was a plan several years ago to add a pocket track to allow for additional frequency of lines on the downtown loop.  That RTD didn't include such a capacity upgrade during a period of massive headaches for commuters is miopic. \n\nRTD is missing the point that they shouldn't just be trying to maintain what they have but should be building in latent capacity to upgrade service as conditions change.  Sure, they don't have the manpower right now to operate the light rail system at pre-2020 headways, but not putting in the ability to do so for a modest cost during a sustained shutdown is really shortsighted.\n\nOf course, boardmembers would actually have to have knowledge of the system to ask questions like this.",

They don't provide any advantage over other modes of transport, they are set up to cater only to people who have to use them, not who choose to use them. Ridership will undoubtedly fall, but probably not a lot, as there likely aren't all that many riders still taking it regularly by choice anyway.",

      "I think the ball team and gun club sponsor could have handled this better at least based on this article. It's weird they did not. But this article comes from one source. That too is weird.\n\n&gt; Dad Tony Stitt said the parents of kids in the Golden Junior Baseball Association weren‚Äôt told the names of the team sponsors until their children had already signed up. \n&gt;\n&gt; The name of the gun club would be displayed on the jerseys of children around 9 years old. \n&gt;\n&gt; ‚ÄúThe lack of contextual awareness of the board and approving that, and then not informing the parents and not giving them a chance to swap out teams,‚Äù frustrated Stitt. ‚ÄúBut all that seems to be resolved.‚Äù\n&gt;\n&gt; Since parents complained, the baseball association in Golden has pulled the gun club as a sponsor. And that is only after a compromise failed, according to Stitt.\n&gt;\n&gt; He said a proposed solution from the association was to give the children of families who objected different jerseys. Stitt wanted to move his son to another team, but that was rejected.\n&gt;\n&gt; **The back-and-forth with the league raised some follow-up questions for Stitt, like why aren‚Äôt the sponsors advertised on the website or disclosed to the parents in advance? The ‚Äúsponsors‚Äù page on www.gjba.net is blank.**\n&gt;\n&gt; Also, what is the process for selecting and approving sponsors? \n&gt;\n&gt; ‚ÄúI said, ‚ÄòWould you allow a marijuana dispensary, perfectly legal, to advertise?

      "PRRS is not a government entity, and they have no legal authority to levy or collect fines. They are a collection agency, nothing more.  The reason so many people succeed with the proof-of-debt request is that (with one big exception) that $87 charge is not a legal debt.  The exception is when the possibility of incurring an $87 fine is *clearly and conspicuously posted* upon entry to the parking lot.  Yeah, very few parking lots do this.\n\nThis has been adjudicated at the Federal appeals court level, believe it or not.  When you use a private parking facility, you are entering into a contract with the operator, and the terms of that contract must be clearly posted to the users of said lot in order to be enforceable.  If they don't say you can be charged $87 for not paying, then they can't come after you for it.  Their only recourse is whatever remedies are stated in their license with the city, such as booting or towing in the case of non-payment, but these also need to be posted. (There's probably a rusty, bent-up Wyatt's sign hanging by one nail on a phone pole near the lot somewhere. Apparently, that's sufficient.)\n\nIn your case, I'd pay for the parking that you actually used, but not to PRRS.  I'd send it directly to whomever runs the parking lot along with a request for them to fix their machine.  And, assuming there is no mention of exorbitant penalties at the parking lot (you need to be sure of this), you can tell PRRS to take a hike with a debt-validation letter.  This has worked for me."

After the pushback from the apartment complex and lack of response from the Police we didn‚Äôt bother reporting the second times, especially as there wasn‚Äôt damage so we didn‚Äôt need a police report for an insurance claim. \n\nI know I‚Äôm biased but it‚Äôs hard to truly believe this good news",

One is just a straight up like Carnie booth where you throw stuff to win prizes. I saw the lady from the Oriental Massage store just clipping her nails into a trash can. Another store is just like some AI art shit where you can get a poster of Goku wearing a Broncos jersey. \n\nAll around depressing and weird. Feels like it‚Äôs on the verge of imploding completely.",

      "5280 and Gapo Taco both closed as well last week. Owned by the same people apparently but yeah. I talked to one of the waitresses on the last day. She said they didn‚Äôt know they were closing until that morning and the mall refused to help them with things that weren‚Äôt working while getting more expensive, so they left.",
      "This mall is so bizarre and always has been. It's got some weirdness in the random wacky shops, mixed with relatively boring and common big name stores, (Dicks, Burlington Coat Factory, etc), then out of nowhere there's the gems like an official Lego store. \n\nI sold an old Colecovision at the old-school 2nd hand game shop there for $50. I felt pretty good about that. \n\nAlso the tailor near Target is highly recommended. Katalina Chai is pretty good too.",
      "They discussed razing the whole building after the hailstorm instead of repairing it. I don‚Äôt know developer math, but the company I worked for at the time was contracting for some of the repairs and there were heavy conversations around whether or not the repairs were worth it. Time seems to have proven that it probably wasn‚Äôt.",

      "I really only ever go to that mall for Target and I suspect I‚Äôm not alone in this. ¬†The way Target is attached to the mall with the the entrance in the back doesn‚Äôt really promote going into the mall. ¬†Either I buy things at Target first and go to the front of the store to pay and then double back to go into the store to go to the mall entrance or I shop in the mall first and I have to go all the way up to the front of Target to grab a cart to start my Target shopping. ¬†The extra steps usually cause me to shrug my shoulders and skip the mall. ¬†\n\nI worked at a Target in a mall in South Dakota when I was in college. The Target was attached to the mall on its side rather than the back like Colorado Mills. ¬†The mall entrance was near the cash registers at the front of the store, making it easier to transition from Target shopping to mall shopping.¬†",
      "There was an amazing local hot sauce store there for awhile but it went out of business. My ex and I used to stop by mills specifically for that store and we were super bummed when it was gone one day. The owner was incredibly friendly",
      "Colorado Mills is more of a mess than we realize. I worked there from 2020, to the holidays in 2023, and holy shit. In the last two years, there‚Äôs been two or three shootings, of which the police have made no arrests, the stores didn‚Äôt close, nothing was done by security, no locked doors, NOTHING. People think the hailstorm and the recovery (or lack thereof) have led to it being more or less a ghost town, but what it really is, is just the denver areas shittiest mall. The people that consistently shop there are cheap, rude, and ugly. News flash, normal sensible people don‚Äôt wanna be around filthy smelly dude that are still sagging their pants and shoplifting at age 45. One of the Chinese massage parlors got busted for human trafficking in 2017-2018. The security guards are just high school kids from McLane, so they are usually starting fights rather than ending them.

Otherwise they would work with retailers to fix things and see they do not leave.\n\nI won't be surprised if in the next couple of years everything is gone except the target and the restaurants on the periphery, while the mall is razed and housing is built, something akin to Belmar.\n\nRemindMe! 2 years",

      "I grew up in Estes, and for about 8 years, my mom was the marketing director at the Stanley. I used to run the halls and caves at all times of the day. I also worked there in my 20s as a front desk agent for a few years. \n\nI only had one experience ever. When I was a kid, I was told by a maintenance man that mom was looking for me and was in a room on the fourth floor. This was about 10 pm and I knew we should be going home soon. I ran up the stairs and down the hall to the room she was in. As I was running, I heard heavy footsteps behind me. At first, I thought it was the maintenance man following me trying to stop me from running in the hall so late. When I turned around, there was no one there. When I realized that no one was behind me, I froze in terror. At this point, my mom had heard me and came to yell at me for running down the hall so late at night. When she scolded me quietly from behind, I screamed in pure terror. Needless to say, the 3rd and fourth floor had a lot of sightings and stories when they checked out the next day. üòÜ",
      "Oh wow a topic I can have leget input on. This was probably five years ago. Taking pictures at the top of the stairs, the main stairs, there were orbs. Floating orbs that move at the top of the stairs. This wasnt apart of any tour, a simple set of pictures. Was interesting.",
      "I‚Äôve had friends capture things on camera on the tours, there was definitely something on the photos they took, not just orbs, it was human looking. I‚Äôve never been on the tour, but I‚Äôve been to the Stanley, never upstairs, but there‚Äôs a door in the ‚Äúbasement‚Äù it‚Äôs next to the in house psychic office, it definitely had something to it. I don‚Äôt know what was behind the door, but I know it scared the shit out of me, like I sprinted back up the stairs because it was so strong.",
      "There‚Äôs no such thing as ghosts. Whatever you think happened with the lollipop has a rational explanation. Those tours prey on people‚Äôs ignorance and gullibility",

That you moved in is general acceptance of the risks, crime levels included.\n\nThat said, I currently live in an equally high crime area of Aurora.

I still can‚Äôt get out of my lease. \n\nHonestly, I‚Äôm kind of glad. I panicked initially, but the truth is that I can‚Äôt afford anything better in the area I need to live in. Moving to a different complex wouldn‚Äôt necessarily prevent these things from happening anyway. That‚Äôs just the nature of living in a major city. I don‚Äôt even live in low-cost/affordable housing or anything. It‚Äôs not particularly high crime or dangerous. Just an older, slightly less expensive neighborhood. I‚Äôm actually planning to stay here one more year to pay off my credit card debt. ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è\n\nThe only laws allowing tenants to break a lease (AFAIK; IANAL) are related to habitability of the apartment itself. Mold, asbestos, lack of heat during winter, no water, no locks, giant holes in the roof/walls, etc. Stuff related to the complex itself isn‚Äôt generally considered. \n\nNow‚Ä¶ if it makes you feel any better, most of these types of murders aren‚Äôt going to put you at risk. Unless gangs are literally doing random drivebys or home invasions in your neighborhood, it‚Äôs probably fine. More than likely, it was a disagreement between two people who knew each other. Possibly drug or alcohol related. It‚Äôs unlikely this type of crime will personally affect you unless you‚Äôre friends with the type of people who have these issues.",

      "Obligatory ‚Äúnot your lawyer/not your property manager‚Äù. This is what I would do:\n\nAsk my doctor to give me a doctor‚Äôs note that says I have to move due to a medical issue, and ask the manager if they can provide me with a reasonable accommodation to break my lease with X notice and without a lease break penalty due to medical necessity under the ADA. And I would ask them to email me the official form. They don‚Äôt technically have to, but they are required to try and negotiate under the ADA, so they would probably just let me go due to the liability. I would also remind them that it‚Äôs peak season and they can re-rent the unit for more than if I stayed, so I would essentially be creating value for the rent roll. Or alternatively, I would try calling the corporate office and asking the Regional Manager if I can leave without penalty if I agree to sign an NDA. Either way, they can only charge rent through the notice period or until a new resident is placed, whichever is sooner. Hope that helps, good luck!"

      "It‚Äôs an area in transition. As far as safe‚Ä¶ relatively. Crime definitely exists, but it isn‚Äôt the worst spot in Denver. It‚Äôs very hard to say how it‚Äôll end up. Some kids think they live in the hood over there and like to act like it. It‚Äôs definitely not the hood. It is somewhat close to Montbello, which probably does qualify as a bad area.\n\nMost people who live in GVR are nice though. There‚Äôs a good amount of basic shopping and services. You‚Äôve got relatively good access to the highways to get into Denver. It‚Äôs close ish to really good food in Aurora. The Arsenal is nice to hang out in if you like hiking. It does lack in nicer amenities but the city is building quite a few parks and encouraging good mixed development. Entertainment is lacking.\n\nWe lived over there for 2 years on 61st:\n\n1. Had my car vandalized (attempted break in)\n2. Rear ended by an aggressive driver\n3. A homeless guy ODed on the sidewalk in front of our apartment\n4.

      "North of GVR is High Point, which is where a ton of new construction is going. The GVR King Soopers always has complaints of being under-stocked and a big part of that is how many new homes and apartments have and are being built out there and the KS is older and smaller.\n\n\nThe Walmart off I70 and Tower is shady, with almost everything under lock and key (laundry detergent, face wash, etc.), probably due to the proximity to the highway.\n\nBrighton and Northfield aren't too far away to get to a Target and other restaurants/shops. They're building a Chipotle near 56th and a Cava near GVR Boulevard. The Culver's and the Panera just opened. There was a rumor/plan of a larger than normal Super Target off 56th and Tower, but no idea if that's still happening... That would help with the King Soopers/grocery issue a ton.\n\nThere are good optometrist offices and dental offices nearby, and the Rec center is getting a pool that should open, soon. Traffic will soon increase, as the Pepsi bottling plant is going in off 71st and Tower-ish, as well. \n\nThe airport isn't bad, as planes don't fly super closely most of the time. Spend an hour or two out there to get an idea of the noise level. It's easy to ignore/becomes white noise, at least for me.",

It‚Äôs growing like crazy tons of new businesses and amenities. I would recommend the area but I have heard the older part near Piccadilly road might have more challenges. That said Oakwood homes building brand new nice houses across from there. My biggest complaint with the area is the King Soopers is lacking . Lots of great parks around the area.

      "I want to begin by saying I‚Äôm not an expert on this matter but want to share a teacher‚Äôs perspective. I‚Äôm a teacher at a TINLI school for DPS which means that‚Äôs we naturally get more students who don‚Äôt speak English as we have structures to accommodate for students new to the country. \n\nI‚Äôm not joking every single one of my slides has four different languages written on it to accommodate for English Spanish Vietnamese and French. \n\nJust today I went down to the main office and I saw an outdated roster that said my sixth period has 19 students. That number is now at 36. Of those 36 students, only four is fluent in English. I still remember one day I had a new student and not enough furniture so I had to leave my class to find a supply room with an extra desk and chair while I was supposed to be teaching. I currently have 34 desks so I rely on students being absent or having them use mine as I teach. \n\nThere is no solution. Several months ago I told myself that I just had to make it to summer. I‚Äôm starting to think that this situation won‚Äôt be resolved when the next school year starts in the fall. \n\nIt‚Äôs not perfect but more funding is a good start as there is a shortage of Chromebooks, desks, translators, and anything else you can imagine. \n\nBtw I like my job and think it‚Äôs pretty dope. The newcomers generally end up being my favorite and best students. In one of our staff meetings we found that DPS ran a study and the demographic of students that found the most success were students who tested out of ELD. (Most people probably still call it ESL.)\n\nAgain I like my job but it‚Äôs a shit show lol. I guess I wrote this to show that these students are cool and it‚Äôs honoring that I get to teach students who have gone through so much‚Äîwith or without documentation. And that we‚Äôre overloaded. I think both things can be true and there‚Äôs weird nuance to it all being in the eye of the storm",
      "This article is paywalled, but what exactly are the additional funds for? To hire additional teachers to teach English to them or something?",

Target can be really cheap between their circle app/ibotta/paper coupons but that can be a lot of extra work and planning.",

      "I‚Äôve found it depends on what I‚Äôm buying. There are some things I only get at Target, some I found cheapest at Whole Foods, some (rarely) at Sprouts. I‚Äôve also had good luck at HMart and the POM. Recently I used Pine Melon and with the specials they had going on the meat and produce was *exceptionally cheap* but I‚Äôm sure that varies based on seasonality and promotions.\n\nETA: sorry yes, it‚Äôs called GW Supermarket now. Out of habit I have just always called it the POM.",
      "Walmart is cheaper for sure.\n\n\nCostco has good prices on staples. For example if your whole family eats oatmeal every day for breakfast, the savings on oats would just about pay for the membership. Flour, rotisserie chicken, breakfast cereal, chips, are some of the best deals assuming you can store and use the bulk amounts. But you have to watch out because there are plenty of bad deals there. If you find things on sale/clearance at regular stores you can get close to or occasionally beat the Costco price.¬†\n\n\nTrader Joe's has good deals on some things, but also lots of bad deals hidden by small portion sizes.¬†\n\n\nAsian grocery stores tend to have good prices.",
      "Surprised no one is talking about Trader Joe‚Äôs. \n\nit certainly is surprisingly cheap. \n\nAs a single person shopping for one, I spend about $80-100 per week, but could cut that down to $50 if times were harder, and have done so occasionally",
      "Sav-a-Lot.",

      "Walmart is the cheapest but I prefer king soopers for my meat and deli meats and veggies.

      "My girlfriend and I have been going to Costco the past few years. Mainly we'll buy big packs of frozen fish, chicken, beef, and veggies. We defrost things as we need them.",
      "I am reluctant to share this as the deals are so good, but Amazon Fresh often drastically slashes the price on groceries and household items for no rhyme or reason. Everything I've gotten that's deeply discounted has been perfectly good, not super close to expiration, etc.\n\nHere's one of my receipts from the other week:  \n[https://imgur.com/a/Ak4Qj5Q](https://imgur.com/a/Ak4Qj5Q)",
      "Yeah depending on what you buy Walmart is usually cheaper for a lot of stuff. Don't love shopping there for multiple reasons but if you need groceries as cheap as possible it's a decent bet and there's usually one nearby.",
      "If ever on the north end of town, there's an [Esh's Market](https://eshsgrocery.com/) in Dacono (Loveland one even better). Lots of stuff at or near-to an expiration date, and with that some steep discounts. Some brands too, you won't find most places.",
      "I found that Soopers has the cheapest chicken. But the downtown Soopers doesn‚Äôt offer the larger/cheaper packs of poultry. Not sure where you live but that could be a factor",
      "Esh‚Äôs in Dacono is amazing",
      "Walmart and Target, depending on what you‚Äôre buying. Target has the red circle app that comes a lot of deals, you just have to go in and manually apply those deals before checkout",
      "I‚Äôll start by telling you that King Soopers is the most expensive. If you compare between them and Whole Foods, 80% stuff at WF is actually cheaper. \n\nMy best luck has been a combination of Target and TJs. Target for everything I can‚Äôt get from TJs because honestly it‚Äôs mind blowing how cheap you can get groceries at Trader Joe‚Äôs. I know that there is a lot they don‚Äôt have but if you buy everything you can there you‚Äôll save a ton of money.",

Totentanz at The Crypt is a much more enjoyable night if you're searching out that old school Denver goth night feel. But the scene definitely isn't the same as it used to be which is a shame.

      "Hot pads and Zillow have plenty of options. You‚Äôre looking at $2k minimum plus pet fees and probably closer to $2.5k and could easily hit $3k if you want to be downtown.",
      "Apartment hunting services like Viva are free because certain apartment communities pay them to place you there. They are not after your best interest and will try to place you wherever is paying them the most. They really only work with luxury buildings as they are the only ones that can afford the fee. You are better off looking on your own.",
      "Literally google apartments in Denver and read reviews and schedule yourself, most you can just walk in and look at/get info. Likely your budget is the reason.",
      "What is your budget?",
      "You probably aren't going to find a 2 bed with those amenities for 2.2k in a decent area. I pay nearly that for a 1 bed.",
      "Use Zillow or Apartments .com and filter them out",
      "Zilllow, Facebook, Craigslist, etc. Sounds like time to do some research",
      "If you want to stay within that range, I suggest getting rid of 1 or more of those amenities, such as central air and in-unit washer dryer. If you‚Äôre able to do that, you‚Äôll be able to make it happen. We just moved from Glendale and our 2 br was about $1500. Aurora might have some similar pricing. \n\nIf you‚Äôre able to make it happen, driving around desired neighborhoods like cap hill and looking for ‚Äúfor rent‚Äù signs by private owners might help you find a great deal.",
      "I used Smart City when I was moving from out of state and ended up moving into a property they found for me (recently renewed my lease, too). But like others have said, they're only going to show you properties they have contracts with. There's nothing to lose by asking them to help you, imo, especially while you're in town. Then when you have a better idea of neighborhoods, you can do your own search as well.",
      "This is just my opinion, I lived here for three years.\n\nTop Neighborhoods (expensive, but very safe and lots of amenties): Highlands (younger vibes), Cherry Creek (more families), Wash Park (mix of hipsters and families), Platt Park (mostly families)\n\nUpper Mid Neighborhoods (lower price in exchange for higher crime, still lots to do, probably your best bet): Lodo (fratty ballpark area), RiNo (more breweries, gyms, etc), Cheesman Park (more families and shopping), University (self-explanatory), Sloan's Lake/West Colfax (similar areas but Sloan's Lake has slightly higher housing prices and lower crime), South Broadway (fun hipster thrift stores and underground music), City Park (nature, theaters, restaurants, etc.), Edgewater (technically not Denver but close), Speer (sports, performing arts, grocery shopping, etc.).\n\nLower Mid Neighborhoods (lower price, low crime, very little to do): University Hills, Golden Triangle, Belcaro, Auraria (mostly college housing), North/South Park Hill (slightly higher in cost), Englewood (very close to Denver, mostly big box shopping centers)\n\nOnly live here if absolutely necessary (for various reasons): Westwood/Barnum (very few amenities, higher crime, industrial vibes), Regis (middle of nowhere Christian college neighborhood by the highway), Cole/Elyria (next to Purina factory, yuck), Globeville (isolated from rest of city by I-70, few amenties),  Cap Hill (biggest crime zone in the city, but lots to do), Montbello (middle of nowhere, high crime), Baker (higher crime part of South Broadway)\n\nDo Not Recommend: East Colfax (high crime, virtually no amenities, businesses constantly closing because crime is so high they cannot retain employees out of fear of being attacked), Five Points (few amenities, high crime)\n\nAll that being said, apartment quality varies widely between neighborhoods even in good neighborhoods. Read reviews carefully. Different things matter to different people. Also, an ESA is your legal right, no apartment can legally forbid you from having one.\n\nPersonally, I used to live in LoDo and now I live in West Colfax (Luxe at Mile High) and love it. The apartment complex itself is wonderful and management could not be any better. I'd say the crime is medium, there are occasional car break ins but very few violent crimes (my car got broken into more when I lived in LoDo than West Colfax). I enjoy the breweries, parks, restaurants, libraries, and light rail access, just wish there were more \"young people\" things to do like bars, clubs, and music venues. But I also value different things than you might; I'd rather have a little crime than live in a safe but unwalkable suburban parking lot.",
      "Am finding tons of apts (and some town homes) on Zillow in your &lt;$2.2k price range (which you should have made clear in your initial post BTW!) with central air, in-unit washer &amp; dyer, and dishwasher. I myself live in a 2b/1b townhome for  &lt; $1700 in Aurora in a decent neighborhood.\n\nYou just need to loosen your location requirements/expectations (forget downtown - not worth it IMHO - look more towards the eastern side of metro) and search a bit better. Once you have a list of at least 3 potential places to see, line up walkthroughs for when you'll be in town and jump on the one that you have a good feel for + neighborhood vibes (wait any longer and rents will go up &amp; up).",
      "You should be able to find something that matches in Lakewood, probably between 2k-2500.  I think a 2/2 in the complex I was at is about 2300 right now.  Not sure how much more the pets would cost though.  As others have mentioned, Zillow Apartments.com, and Trulia are good resources.",

It's a 2br/1ba.",

Never goes out of business. Must have been there for at least 20 years so far. I always thought it was a front for money laundering back in the day. Lol! ü§£ It's annoying to think he's rich and just keeps that store there üôÑ",

There are plenty of other chill/cool comic book shops in the Denver metro area where you can get your nerd on. I Want More Comics up in Thornton, All Cs Collectibles off of 225 and Mississippi, Hall of Justice in Parker... and then there is the biggest comic shop you'll ever see, Mile High Comics Mega Store on Jason Street of I-70.\n\nAll of them are worth checking IMO.

Based on some of his stories I guess he has some long history with chuck at mile high. Never heard of the trust fund thing but I know he's from Chicago and has a wacky past. If you get to know him he's not that bad but don't get caught listening to one of his stories, you'll definitely regret it. I always have an exit strategy just in case. Maybe try going again, I bet he won't remember you. Heck even after multiple chats I've had with him over the years I still get this uneasy feeling and like he doesn't remember who I am.

      "It doesn't outlaw parking. It just says you can't dictate a parking minimum. Parking isn't going anywhere. This just allows market economics to better decide how much of it is built.",
      "This bill makes it easier to move into those places that don‚Äôt require as much parking as the minimum. It‚Äôs a virtuous cycle. Excess parking gets repurposed adding to the number of homes and businesses in those locations making them more walkable and accessible. Each spot is 300, SQFT, so 2 can be a 1 BD apartment. Plus you save up to 30k from the construction costs in addition to that opportunity cost. Those extra business may will make the area more walkable further reducing the need for parking. Additional walkability plus less cars will help RTD increase fare revenue and ridership. Adding fund both directly and indirectly through grants, further making car free and car light living possible. \n\nLet‚Äôs remember most households have 2 cars and downtown there is Colorado Carshare for people who only need a car a few times a month. So there is a lot of middle ground for people who looking to drop a car. My family at one point had 4 cars for 4 people because where I grew up you couldn‚Äôt get anywhere without one.",
      "It's a bill to eliminate parking _minimums_, but does not mandate a parking maximum.\n\nWith or without this bill, nothing stops developers from building as much parking as they want to or as much as they feel is financially viable. But the opposite is not true - developers often have to divert project funds that could otherwise provide more residential units, more commercial units, or more office units just to satisfy arbitrary parking requirements - even in cases where the developer and the property owner know it's effectively wasted.\n\nI'd expect a much better balance to come out of this. Less seas of empty parking lots, more housing/commercial/etc. units per building on average, a general increase of density, and a long term increase in walkable areas.",
      "It seems like a good thing to do. It gives more power to each independent business or developer to make their parking lots as big as they want. Allows more area of a commercial lot to be used for retail space or office space instead of parking.\n\nToo much land area is wasted with parking. I see so many parking lots around that are never even half full. Parking in Denver is easy if you're willing to walk 50 feet. Lived here 15 years and never had a problem parking close enough to anything.\n\nAnd remember, this is not a requirement to have less parking. It just allows a developer to do what they want with their land. They can build out as much parking as they want.",

With Tovala's meal plan, there might be minimal \"prep\" - like a literal two minutes putting food into the cooking container (included and recyclable) and maybe putting sauce or sprinkling a packet on top. No cutting, no measuring, no \"real\" prep. And, we re-used the tins until we bought a silicone version of them on Amazon. Perfect runny yolk eggs every time. When I was at my sickest point (cancer with a lot of hospital time), it helped us to be able to still have healthier and easy meals. \n\nTovala is fantastic as a usable appliance and it can air fry, too. It doesn't heat up our place the way a traditonal oven does so we end up using it for a ton of things. And, with the buying meals in lieu of paying more for the stove helped make sure we used it and got used to it. We've had it for almost 3 years. We've stopped and re-started the meal service several times, but we use it daily with or without it.\n\nSuvie is a similar, but different type of oven. I've debated trying it out, too. It's more expensive, but it has two different \"cook zones\" aka separate areas that can have very different settings. It has its own meal service, but is compatible with others.

We had a few drinks at my friend‚Äôs place and then took an Uber to Federales. I was at a great level of buzz and decided to not drink at Federales because I felt great as I was and didn‚Äôt want to spend money. I started drinking water and talking to some random people at the bar. After a little bit I started feeling super hot and sick. I literally felt like I just took 7 shots of tequila. I went outside in the cold to sober up a little (it always helps) I felt more drunk after I kept drinking water. I thought to myself I drank too much- then I started to chug cups of water and I could barely function. The more water I drank the more ‚Äúdrunk‚Äù I felt. My friends had to call my husband to pick me up from the bar. Right when I got into his truck I immediately puked and started crying. I was spinning and felt hot- I had never in my life felt like this. When we got home my husband had to put me in our tub because I was uncontrollably puking and shaking for hours. I puked about 15 times that whole night until about 10am the next morning. It was horrifying. I couldn‚Äôt  get out of bed or eat or drink anything. I finally got out of bed 24hrs later to use the bathroom. I remember looking in the mirror and around my eyes were swollen and a little red. It was an absolutely horrific experience. \n\nPeople suck.

Made it a good ways down Speer before some very kind person stopped to help me get an Uber home. I put in my parents address (who live in TN) and ended up way out in Lakewood and then screamed and cried and the Uber had to call the dude and I went back to his place in Highland where he stood on the sidewalk with me until another Uber came and I put the right address in. My BF found me outside our door asleep at like 6am because he‚Äôd been out looking for me all night. The ‚Äúfriends‚Äù didn‚Äôt believe me when I told them it happened and I even went to Anschutz and had the forensics nurse confirm the drugging‚Ä¶  \n  \nI was also drugged at Stanley Marketplace on a slow Monday night out with a coworker at like 7pm. I had two drinks and then blacked out for 12 hours straight. Coworker was gonna take the bus home but I guess I insisted on driving them which thank god I did (even though I literally don‚Äôt remember driving) because by the time we got to their place I couldn‚Äôt walk or talk really except to agree with them and they took me inside and texted my BF to come get me.

Most flat roofs aren't truly flat, they have a slight run into the gutter. \n\nMost flat roofing membranes are heat-welded at the seams, or they use an incredibly strong adhesive making them water-tight. Additionally, the snow we get here is significantly lighter than Midwest and East Coast snow (originally from NE OH).\n\nIf she has heat tape at the gutter, that will ensure that there isn't a buildup of snow at the edge of her roof which tends to cause problems with the freezing and thawing throughout the winter. \n\nHope that helps!",

      "I just switched because we kept hitting the 1.2TB cap a lot and it was getting costlier. \n\nThe install experience was super good! Took like under 30 mins, been about three weeks I think and they haven‚Äôt buried yet but said once the utilities are marked (happened last week) they‚Äôll send someone out. \n\nSpeed wise I‚Äôve gotten 1.1gbs on a test which was sick to see. However the mesh equipment they give you kind of sucks, I ended up paying for my own equipment and have much better results now. I was seeing massive latency that affected online gaming &amp; the modem isn‚Äôt in a great spot unfortunately (might see if they can relocate it for me) so most devices connect from a pod then to the main router. \n\nThe new ones I picked up had better band support &amp; coverage so I saw much better speeds &amp; latency. \n\nBut yes you can use your own equipment, just plug the ethernet from the modem into your router system.",
      "Quantum Fiber is CenturyLink",
      "I had Quantum fiber installed this past saturday. I got the 500mbps for 50 for life package. Its actually works as adveristed and my down load upload has not gone below 300 yet and seem to be 1:1.\n\nEveryone is going to have a different experience with internet depending on where they live and who they get to install, but Xfinity pissed me off a ton in a three month period and made it super easy to switch from an 80 dollar bill to a faster 50 dollar one",
      "I use both - Q gigabit fiber for my main and Xfinity 300 as a failover.  \n\nYou HAVE to use your own router with Q, they'll give you a modem and what you have is not compatible.  \n\nWhy would it be slower?  940 is technically slower than 1000 but Q is symetrical gigabit and you don't have a contract and also don't have data caps - it also has better uptime and reliability and is cheaper than the gigabit alternative from xfinity.",
      "Most people posting seem to have had a good experience, but I'll post mine. \nWe bought a new build and wanted to get internet set up. We called Century Link and they said we could totally get fiber at our place. But once the tech got to our house, he said the node that connects our neighborhood to the internet wasn't installed yet. After that, CL gave us the run around, saying they were sending a tech out to finish connecting us. But the window as all day, literally 8am to 4pm. After the second time of it hitting 4 and the tech canceling because no one was home (we were home), I went with xfinity. They gave us a two hour window and showed up right at the start of it. We had internet hooked up within 30 minutes.",
      "I made the switch and it was great until Centurylink said it would take a WEEK to get someone out to fix my connectivity issue",
      "Once I learned Quantum was just CenturyLink 2.0... That made the decision for me. Used to have to call Century Link every few months... Haven't had to call Xfinity in years now... No thanks... Centurylink sucked for the first 10 years we lived here... Ill not be switching back... regardless of how much I hate comcast, Centurylink was worse.",
      "I have made the switch and it was night and day.\n\nThe install process for me was great - schedule the appointment, they show up, ask you what place in the house you would like the modem installed, which for us had to be on the wall. Once it was done, we always have 940 up and download speed. If this is an option for you, I would take it. Comcast couldn't come close to matching what Quantum Fiber offers. \n\nThe only hard part was not smiling when I went into a Comcast store to cancel. I decided to do this because I wanted to get a receipt to ensure they didn't try to sneak in any random billing charges.",
      "Network is a lot flatter and more direct to the internet than comcast so things will seems a little snappier. their fiber speeds top out at 1g up/down right now. In my experience, it's pretty stable.\n\nHaving said that, I just got upgraded to comcast's 1.2g/200m plan, and its been really stable for me. I'm looking forward to the next x-class packages later this year that will offer 2g symmetrical with no cap. I pay for the no cap plan right now since we stream everything.",
      "We have quantum 200 plan for $30 and it‚Äôs plenty of bad width for our home.   Speed is fast, 940 isn‚Äôt faster just allows more devices to connect but hard to see how a household would need it.  4k streaming is only 20-25 Mb.",
      "Yep! It‚Äôs great. Fiber is the shit",
      "My current [upload/download statistics](https://imgur.com/a/xNVRVq0) on quantum over the last 30 days:\n\n7.85 TiB (Out)\n1.54 TiB (In)\n\nPeering is also really nice for a residential connection. I‚Äôm never more than a few hops from most other major networks. CenturyLink is a Tier 1 internet service provider so it‚Äôs less likely data goes through transit. \n\nAs a previous xfinity customer it‚Äôs a 10/10\n\nEdit: You are not required to use their supplied router. I‚Äôm using my own (pfsense) along with my own switches and AP‚Äôs. No problems",
      "Wish I could. We've had surveyors from CL walk thru our yard without permission like 3 times and stab little flags in the ground where the lines are located.

      "The pods didn't work with our smart TV very well but I think it's the TV's fault. We swapped to our own equipment, and everything works great. The TV kept disconnecting from the wifi, just couldn't keep it on the network without splitting the network into 2.5 and 5. Now that we've done that it's fine",
      "Yes it‚Äôs great!!",
      "It‚Äôs great and I miss that I can‚Äôt get it at my current house.  Comcast is the worst and as soon as I have a viable alternative I‚Äôm done. \n\nRemember centurylink‚Äôs old DSL and fiber are completely different.",
      "Centurylink has the worst support on planet earth, but I assume that Comcast is even worse, if you know what I mean. But, we have had zero need for support in 3 years and I assume Quantum is basically the same thing. The internet practically never goes down. I've personally never noticed it down in the time we've had it. I put in a dream machine 3 weeks ago and it shows a perfect 100% uptime since then. I like that with some finagling you can get your PPPoE password and just pitch their modem in the bin and use your own hardware behind the ONT. The symmetrical 1Gbps service I have will hit about 950 sometimes, but day in and day out it hits 850/750, and I'm not really complaining about that, especially not for $60/month.",
      "I switched just a few months ago and I‚Äôm not looking back. Used my own TP Link Deco mesh setup with their optical modem and I‚Äôm getting great speeds with my $50/month 500/500 plan. Xfinity kept raising prices, and their 5mbs upload cap is a joke.\n\nHere‚Äôs my referral link if you want, we both get $100 if you sign up: http://aklam.io/1Gk3Yb",
      "If anyone didn‚Äôt know, you can request 2 more mesh pods for free from Quantum Fiber in their app",
      "Yep, have had quantum for a couple years now &amp; it‚Äôs been flawless. Have used all standard gear they provided. Fuck Comcast",
      "We swapped because we dropped the last bit of cable. \n\nWe‚Äôve been lucky and had great service.",
      "I switched to CenturyLink from Xfinity a few years ago after moving into a new build. At first, we tried to get Quantum Fiber because we kept receiving the flyers for it, but there was some kind of miscommunication and it turns out we couldn't get Quantum Fiber. So we pivoted to CenturyLink and things were fine at first, speed was comparable and the customer service was friendly and usually responded to our issues quickly. \n\nHowever, in the last few months of me living in that house, our service went out for a couple days at a time once every 6-7 weeks. My friend continued living at this house and the service interruptions continued after I moved out. He switched to Xfinity a little less than a year ago.",

      "You can easily buy legit psilocybin online, shipped to your door. Micro-dosing and hero dosing.",
      "Like several people have said, mushrooms are in an awkward spot legally right now. It is legal to grow, consume, and gift them, but illegal to sell. The grey market is also in flux trying to figure out what exactly will be prosecuted or not. There are services that sell a 20 min consultation with a free gift, or something similar like buying an expensive post card with a free gift.\n\nIf you see chocolates explicitly for sale, they could either be fake or the shop is willing to risk it because no one is really being arrested for it right now. Personally, I wouldn't really trust chocolates because you don't know what's in them (could be fake, could be poorly extracted, could be contaminated, etc). But YMMV.",

      "Once the licensing is figured out (end of 24), you'll only be able to buy and consume on premises. There won't be shops selling like marijuana.  It is also not decriminalized but legal to grow and consume psilocybin currently.  You can give it away but not sell.",
      "Probably not actual shrooms but a chemical like others said.  I've done the real stuff a few times in my life and tried the 'fake' stuff, and the fake stuff doesn't compare.  That said, they're easy to grow yourself.\n\nr/unclebens",
      "It‚Äôs been decriminalized now, it‚Äôs just that it now became legalized, which is different than decriminalizing something.\n\nAccording to this article I found it‚Äôs still not happening for most places to sell until late 2024 when the licensing can be given out. \n\nhttps://www.cpr.org/2023/06/21/colorado-psychedelic-law-for-psilocybin-mushrooms/\n\nSo yeah, my guess is, it‚Äôs ‚Äúunder the radar‚Äù (I laugh as I imagine giant sale signs) if you‚Äôre seeing it and unless you believe they‚Äôre reputable I wouldn‚Äôt trust it.\n\nEdit: removed sentence.

A car isn't going to lane split without an accident no matter what the speed though I have seen passing attempts that make me wonder if many drivers understand physics.\n\nPersonally, I am not surprised with the change in the law, that many people behave stupidly thinking that the change is far more than they think it is.

      "&gt;  Who picked Ellsworth to be '0th' street?\n\nCity council as a consequence of Ordinance 50 of 1886.\n\nIn 1871, First Avenue was declared (today's) 35th Avenue, and numbering continued southwards. So 16th Avenue then would be (today's) 20th Avenue.\n\nBut when Ordinance 50 was passed, it defined the North/South numbering scheme to align with the downtown numbering scheme, e.g. 17th Ave would be the road running east from 17th St at Broadway. The streets counted down from there southwards until Ellsworth then became the 0th street.\n\nIf you're interested in more, I'd highly recommend the book Denver Streets by Phil Goodstein.",

It makes it easy to calculate distances.  For example 120th Ave (12000 north) to Colfax (1500 North) is 13-1/8  miles.  From Colorado (4000 East) to Yosemite (10500 East) = 4-1/16 miles and so on.",

      "I‚Äôm on Denver health elevate gold. It‚Äôs been decent and the doctors at the facility are really good. I have a bunch of medical conditions I‚Äôm being treated for and they are on it. They use MyChart too which is so convenient for me with ADHD",

      "Denver Health is the primary \"safety net\" hospital in Denver, so they are known mostly for serving low income clientele (medicaid). They also run a network of primary care clinics around town.\n\nTheir insurance plans are really only worth it if you plan to receive care within the DH network, so it helps to live near the hospital itself and/or one of the primary care clinics. My experience with them is a bit out of a date, but trying to get care from them at non-DH facility or provider was a huge PITA.\n\nThat said, I think you could probably get amazing medical care there. Their medical staff are excellent (because they see such a wide range of patients) and caring. However, you should also be prepared to be organized and advocate for yourself. It's a big system and it's easy to get lost in it if you're not tracking your own stuff.\n\n If you're relatively young and relatively healthy and live relatively near one of their clinics, it'll be fine.",
      "Not me, but a friend told me just yesterday that she was really happy with her Denver Health plan. She just started a new job and has to transition to Kaiser and she's bummed to have to leave her DH plan.",
      "I‚Äôm on a Denver Health Elevate plan and love it. The quality of care is top notch and referrals are easy enough to get (at Kaiser, it was like pulling teeth to get one). Also, I never have to wait too long for an appointment. Though I have to wait longer than my newborn baby who can literally get in to see his pediatrician same day, if needed. \n\n10/10 recommend as someone who‚Äôs also been on Kaiser, BCBS, United, etc.",
      "[Denver Health](https://www.denverhealth.org/) runs a major medical center downtown along with a bunch of clinics and such in the area. Its not some tiny random company. Their plan is cheaper because you're restricted to Denver Health and other participating local providers, so the network is pretty restrictive.",
      "I was having a hell of a time even getting an appointment to get just a regular check up with the Denver Health Plan. I never went through with it and cancelled it because my husband got a new job with health insurance for us. So can't comment on the actual health care, but my first impressions just attempting to use the insurance that cost me $330/mo to have a huge deductible were pretty bad.",
      "How long have you been unemployed and do you plan to go back to work?  Take a good look into your COBRA options from your last employwer. While it may be expensive to sign up, you do have a certain amount of time (60 days I think) when you can elect to take coverage.  AND you can take it in arrears.  Meaning you don't necessarily have to sign up for it unless something happens and you're still within your window of being able to elect it and you're still covered.",
      "all denver metro hospitals will take denver heath ins.  plans.  its similar to colorado medicaid but denver based for quicker approval",
      "I haven't used Denver Health Plans, but I've used Denver Health as my provider with payment through Medicaid and I have only had positive experiences with them as a provider. This has run the gamut from checkups through cancer screenings and surgery/treatment. If their insurance plans fit your needs and budget, I'd say go for it.",
      "I‚Äôm on DH elevate gold plan because I used to work there and wanted to keep my doctors. Pretty reasonable prescription prices (main reason I chose this plan over others). I have received great care at DH and many other plans, such as United, didn‚Äôt cover my prescriptions. \n\nIf you need behavioral health not for substance use, the wait is about a year. If you are using this plan for behavioral health I would not recommend DH insurance.",
      "Expensive? It should be based on your income.",
      "I have medicare, Medicaid and a weird medigap plan and use Denver Health.   They‚Äôve been really great and helpful.  I chiefly use the family practice clinic and infectious disease.  They‚Äôre very aware of other community resources and are great with referrals and advocacy.",
      "I was on the Denver Health Elevate Gold plan for about 8 months while I was between jobs. The premium for my wife and I together was $688/month and then $18/month for dental insurance. The deductible for the two of us was $3.2k, out of pocket max I believe was around $9k. There was a lower premium/higher deductible plan as an option but our preference is to err on the side of a lower deductible.  I've always had pretty positive experiences with Denver Health. I went to their East Side Family Clinic for a while to see my primary care physician. Last week I had to go to Urgent Care down at their office at Bannock and Speer; it was fast and the staff was friendly and helpful. The premium was expensive but Denver Health in General has been good from my experience.",

      "I'd stay away from it. Only really works at Denver Health medical centers. I've tried to use their out-of-network program (can't remember the name). Was told with 99% confidence that an MRI would be covered (their centers didn't have availability for 6+ months) and I ended up having to pay out of pocket for the entire MRI. \n\n  \nI also just had a lot of issues with their in-network primary care physicians. It took me forever to get one, and once I did I couldn't just book an appointment with them if I was sick or something, I had to book months in advance. I ended up using a lot of urgent care while on that plan."

These days I prioritize quality over quantity, price over ambiance, and health over convenience.

You knew the menu backwards and forwards, made recommendations, you paired wines with meals, you kept water glasses full, you coursed meals and did all that and more with a personality - that was a 20% tip. Now it‚Äôs typically this: I walk up to order at the counter, I serve myself drinks, fill my own water glass and occasionally bus my own tables, plus deal with low wattage/unhappy imbeciles for $100 meal and then you flip the iPad around and I‚Äôm expected to tip 20% too?

      "I've worked in the restaurant industry since 2012. Last year, I decided to go back to school because I could tell things were getting bad and I needed to do something else with my life. The bar I was working at closed down last month due to bankruptcy and the restaurant I was working at prior to that is also on the verge of being shut down.\n\nI actually did a research paper this semester on the effects that the COVID-19 pandemic had on the restaurant industry, specifically server incomes. But I also explored the rising costs of business operations as well as the rise in delivery apps and ghost kitchens. Prior to the pandemic, restaurant sales were actually expected to rise dramatically. The pandemic stopped everything in it's place and nothing has been the same since. Part of this of course is the cost of eating out. For as expensive as groceries are, it is still much, much cheaper to eat at home. And on the topic of delivery services, UberEats and the likes charge such insanely high fees to restaurant that if you aren't a corporate brand, you most likely can't afford it. People around here looooove their UberEats, but the only restaurants you see anymore are chain brands or places that cater specifically to carry-out (like pizza shops and Chinese take-out). So smaller restaurants aren't getting any business in that regards. Smaller, family-owned places are dying, and it's so sad.\n\n I don't have all my research on hand right now, but I can definitely share some of it if anyone is interested.",

      "I think it has a lot to do with rapid rise in costs for everything here, but wages haven‚Äôt scaled to accommodate Denver now being a HCOL area. Others are commenting that we have LA and NYC prices for eating out, but if you live in those places, for an equivalent job you could have here, you get paid 20-30% more. \n\nAlso, in places like NYC, I think there is a higher portion of the population that have high earning jobs and many people move there for the city culture (which includes eating out), while most people move to Denver for the outdoors, not the city itself.",

      "About a week and a half back, on Wednesday afternoon, I got some really big work news. Boyfriend wanted to take me out to celebrate. Over my lunch break, we talked about a couple of options but neither of us was super hungry so figured we'd decide once I'm off work. Work day ends at 6:00, probably pull out of the parking lot around 6:10 and with a 20 minute commute, I'm in the door just after 6:30. At home, we start pulling up options and we're immediately crestfallen. Realize just about everything is closing in the next 90 minutes. 8pm seems insanely early for a dinner establishment to close, especially as people who dont usually eat til 7:00/7:30. Sure, if we'd have rushed out the door that second, we could have probably enjoyed ourselves well enough but as people who've both worked in food service ourselves, neither of us like being the kinda folks getting booted out at closing. Plus this is meant to be a nice celebratory meal. We'd wanted to have a few drinks and enjoy desert maybe, not just sit, eat and run.¬†\n\n\nEnded up having mac and cheese that night and going out a few days later when I had the day off. Would be nice if restaurants other than fast food places gave a shit about more than just their customers who work 9-5s.¬†",
      "Don't mistake change for death. About 30% of restaurants don't survive the first year. By year 5, 80% will close. What you're seeing is normal for a larger city IMO. \n\nDenver has seen a lot of growth in recent years. I'm from Chicago and I've watched one particular restaurant in a fantastic corner location get turned over, like clockwork, every 3 years for the last 15. Closed for renovations, re-opened as a newish concept. Same owners. Same location. They rebrand it just to get customers back in the door. The location great but they have a lot of competition. It's run by a company called One Hospitality. They are incredibly successful and own strings of restaurants that most people don't realize are related, but they are very canny restauranteurs. I think a lot of owners run their dream into the ground when they should pro-actively close when things start to dip and they still have the money to reconcept and re-open.\n\nThere will always be those few restaurants that become neighborhood stalwarts and live forever but that's about 20% of ventures.  \n\nDon't forget that gentrification and demographics mean the people in a restaurant's neighborhood are constantly changing. The restaurant needs to change too. It's a different game somewhere like 16th Street which is tourist focused, but that's not the majority of restaurants.",
      "I‚Äôve been cooking more at home personally. I went out to breakfast at a joint where the cups were dirty (lipstick still on the glasses), food still stuck to the plates and forks, and the food smelled rancid. For all that, my family was asked to pay $60 plus a 20-25% tip. This is kind of the extreme end of things, but overall most places have been less and less of a treat between quality, cleanliness and service. There are a few I still will routinely visit because it‚Äôs still a good value overall. They‚Äôre still kind of expensive, but worth the price.  I wish more restaurants were on their A game, I‚Äôd gladly pay for that. \nGroceries are expensive but overall I know I‚Äôll get what I want at home and to my taste, likely for less. \nIt really makes me sad for restaurants and their owners - two near me have recently closed after very long runs. One stopped paying their taxes, I guess that can‚Äôt be helped in contributing to the shut down of their business. The other I actually liked and frequented the past six years, but in the past six months stopped because it was increasingly filthy.",
      "It used to be kind of expensive but worth it to go out and grab a burger and a few beers, not have to cook or clean up afterwards. Now it‚Äôs 20 dollars for a normal sized regular old cheeseburger that‚Äôs nothing special. I can buy 8 patties and buns and just make it at home on the grill for that price. And for the price a lot of places are charging for beers anymore I can just buy a six pack. I can‚Äôt remember where I was last month that wanted 12 dollars for a tall Modelo.",
      "I just google mapped random restaurants in Denver and looked at their menus. A chicken breast dish with some sort of cheap green vegetable side is averaging $36. So after all of the complimentary fees, taxes, and tip, a chicken breast comes out to $50. Why would anyone pay $50 for a $4 dish in a world where all other prices are also gouged and wages aren‚Äôt keeping up with it?",
      "It's exciting to eat out, but more often than not I'm disappointed and left wishing that I would've stayed home and cooked my own food. Prices are too high, tipping percentage continues to increase, added fees, and food quality isn't even there for it all to be justified. \n\nSo many restaurants place a premium on aesthetics and decor, but what's the point if the food is subpar or average at best.",
      "I slowed down eating out for COVID and have pretty stopped since. The last time I went out to get some pho I was shocked that they were charging $15 for a medium bowl! Used to love going get a cheap bowl once or twice a week with my wife, but now I have to reaaally be in the mood to pay 45$ for 2 bowls of pho and some egg rolls.",
      "I intentionally go to businesses without added fees. It‚Äôs funny bc I feel like these businesses think we won‚Äôt notice, but I do and then I make another choice.",

      "When they first dropped there were so many crashes like this that the number of ER visits made the news.\n\nPeople are getting a little better, but they still result in a fair number of crashes as you've found out.\n\nIf you're into them, you can buy personal ones, there are a number of shops around that carry and service them. In Colorado they were re-classified as bicycles along with devices like e-skateboards, e-unicycles, etc. and have all the same legal status as bicycles. Maybe grab a couple lights to wear, a helmet, and whatever other PPE you want. Once you feel better of course!\n\nI do recommend lights you can clip on the back of your helmet and shirt/jacket (or wear a little string sling with lights) so cars can see you in the dark (assuming they're looking of course). The stock lights are so low to the ground that drivers sometimes don't register them visually even if they are looking.\n\n  \nedit: I can't confirm, but Uber/Lyft/etc claim the Denver market is in the top performing markets for their shared device rentals (includes bikes). Not sure if that's true but it's probably pretty close, those things are really popular. Hard to believe we have a bigger market for them than some other cities, but I won't complain if it gets people out and about -- and we're getting better about organizing social expectations for them, too. The first couple years were really rough as a LOT of people just went \"free for all\", but that attitude is starting to shift and hopefully will continue to move in the direction of less recklessness (and fewer wrecks).",

We were doing our best to keep this under the radar so the dealer didn‚Äôt get in trouble. \n\nI believe you can file (or threaten to file) a complaint with the dmv regarding the dealer as it is their responsibility to complete their own paperwork correctly. I can‚Äôt recall the division, you can probably google it, but the dealers would all get super nervous when they would come poking around because those fees were hefty!\n\nThe dealership should also be able to issue you another 30 day tag while they fix their mistake. \n\nAll information above came from NC, not sure if CO rules/laws are different."

      "Depends on the variety of grass seed but for cool season grasses, overseed in March/April is the norm. \n\nPersonally, I'm not a fan of dethatching. It's better to top dress compost &amp; work it in to promote microbial activity to break down the thatch. But if the thatch layer is too built up, might need to do it. You would be fine doing hand dethatching now or after the seed is established. Power raking do before over seeding and go ahead &amp; aerate while you are at it.\n\nIdeal would be light hand dethatch (use small/medium metal leaf rake), mow if needed, then aerate &amp; overseed, top dress compost &amp; work in.\n\nFor grasses, I'd recommend a Texas blue grass hybrid. It's typically crossed with a fescue type iirc. Extremely drought tolerant, low water needs, very deep rooting, spreads by both stolons &amp; rhizomes so heals quickly. Holds up really well to foot traffic, full sun &amp; pets. Most varieties also slow their growth once temps hit 90s, so less mowing üòÅ\n\nUnless your sprinkler system is self draining or frost resistant, wait to activate them until next month &amp; do manual watering.\n\nEdit: spelling",
      "I overseeded here in Denver two weeks ago today. Things are germinating nicely. Definitely not too early to overseed cool season grass.",
      "Wait til fall. The best time to seed contrary to popular opinion. The problem with doing it now is the new grass won‚Äôt be strong and healthy enough by the time the summer heat comes along so a lot of it will get torched",

      "I overseeded a small high-traffic area in my lawn today. I'm going to be watering with the hose though since I won't have sprinklers running for a few weeks still. The weather forecasted for the week ahead looks promising to give the new seedlings a good start (hopefully).",
      "Not at all, great time of year to overseed. I‚Äôd do it now and again this fall with a top dressing of compost.",
      "I am overseeding tomorrow and already have the sprinklers turned on. Hopefully, we get rain this weekend.",
      "Too soon to seed or turn sprinklers on. We‚Äôll usually get one more cold snap/snow. Wait till Mother‚Äôs Day. \n\nHand water/hose sprinkler if you have to.\n\nEDIT: What I meant was, if you put down seed and it starts germinating now and starts growing, then we get snow, it‚Äôll most likely kill the new seedlings is what I understand. Seed that hasn‚Äôt sprouted (e. g. dormant seeding) is fine but new little baby grass might not make it through if we get snow.",
      "Aim for a 50 degree average soil temp so seeds germinate.  I would have over seeded this weekend if it weren‚Äôt for the colder temps forecasted this week.",

      "I used a swamp cooler in a south facing second floor room in a brick house. It kept that room cool. But one thing regarding those is buy slightly larger than the square footage rating, particularly if you're susceptible to heat. I doubt one will cover roughly 1,000 square feet considering walls, which will impede airflow somewhat. If your bedroom is 200 sq. ft., for instance, consider getting one rated for at least 300-400 sq. ft.",
      "&gt;Would using a swamp cooler actually be feasible?\n\nLargely no.  The most cooling you can get from a swamp cooler is about 20 degrees, at most.  If the humidity outside sky rockets - you'll only be able to cool off 5 degrees (or less).  We have a massive one on our roof and it works alright.  I'd prefer to have air conditioning if I was building the house from scratch.\n\n&gt;For reference I live in an apartment complex so nothing involving reno. Our apartment is &lt;1000 sq ft., not sure exact square footage.\n\nMy experience with any sort of portable system is that they suck.  Portable swamp coolers do exist - but if I had a medical condition that requires me being cool - I would not trust it to work all the time.  Maybe reframe it mentally as - \"Running the AC is cheaper than an ER bill\".\n\nPerhaps look into something like an Eight Sleep Cooling system?  That will be able to cool over your bed without requiring you to run the AC at max.",

On a 90 degree day its great, keeps the house humidified and everyone is happy. \n  \nOnce it gets above 90 though, things start to slip. And on 100 degree days it basically just prevents us from melting in place\n  \nIf you can't afford AC, do it. If you can afford AC, do both",

You‚Äôll want your insurance to match your residency as well. If you knowingly (and they can prove it) not register your car in Colorado and it should be (you are in Colorado more than 180 days a fiscal year) then you could be subject to a ticket and a up to a $250 fine. \n\nAlso you can‚Äôt always renew your registration online I got an error stating that I don‚Äôt have insurance (which I do) have to go in person to renew and prove that I‚Äôve got insurance.

It may get in the 4‚Äôs, but that‚Äôs with trenching or some other unusual obstacle.  I can‚Äôt imagine a centennial home needing more than average. \n\nWe‚Äôre a small company, and we‚Äôre licensed and have done quite a bit of work in Centennial. Call the number above for a free estimate. You‚Äôll be looking for my partner, Casey. He‚Äôs a great electrician too.",

Those contractors gave you the ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt want to do this pricing‚Äù meaning they don‚Äôt want to do something that cheap unless you make it worth their time"

      "I am a developer, have been for a lot of years. My recommendation is to avoid boot camps, most of the teachers and assistants there have never really been actual devs, especially not in any tech org that I have seen.¬†\n\nMy advice would be to ask yourself what you need, in your case it sounds like basic web application skills. Pick a framework and learn it, maybe through the docs or YouTube or udemy, join their discord or slack and ask questions, write 10+ apps in it, deploy a few of those to different cloud services.¬†\n\nFumbling through stuff is how you learn. If you have to, hire someone to get you unblocked and help you learn. Don‚Äôt have someone do it for you or solve your problems for you. You need someone to teach you the theory and how to think.\n\nI think most startup founders want rapid prototyping and some understanding of what to look for in a CTO. Beyond that and you will need to actually learn how to scale things, architecture, how to actually hire devs of different levels, etc. I think the timeline for that is out of reach and you should focus on hiring the right person to do that for you.¬†",

      "I have hired three graduates of the Flatiron boot camp.  They teach you enough to be proficient in python.  They don't teach any kind of operations or devops, so you won't be exposed to how to deploy your code anywhere other than your laptop.",
      "I went to Turing and would recommend it over other boot camps based on what I have heard. Most have a very positive experience. However, like most things, you get what you pay for. It‚Äôs not cheap and the job market for new devs is pretty bad at the moment.\n\nIf you‚Äôre just looking to put some better tools in the tool belt, I recommend self teaching and/or finding an online curriculum. Coding is a lot of self-teaching anyway even if you‚Äôre in a program. Worst-case scenario you realize you need more support and then spend on the boot camp.",
      "*My Advice as a Dev with a SWE Degree and Current pursuing my masters, with 3 years of Dev work Experience...*  \n  \n**Learning Structure:** Please just pay for code academy premium monthly price $15-20‚Ä¶ It gets you access to a multitude of different learning resources and gamified exercises ran in your browser to see what you actually need to learn / expose yourself to. Especially if you are not looking to get a job out of a boot camp, I just think you'll lose your money, time and knowledge after a bit. Also most boot camps are intended to be full time, so you'll lose time on your tech startup idea. I am positive after a boot camp, you will need to be googling and youtubing for solutions. Also I use AI to write some db queries, small code changes, etc. I don't see an issue with it as long as you can understand what a right solution looks like. \n\n**Entrepreneur Advice:** Focusing on Tech Entrepreneurship within SWE for my masters rn. And have worked on a few ideas. Most Startups either have a technical and or a business founder. Not sure why you can‚Äôt be that side of a partnership. If I was in your shoes, id rather invest that other $9900 into the startup, then trying to spend all 10k of it into learning a boot camp (imo). You could easily contract people to get your idea jump started while you learn new things. I honestly don't think you need to be in boot camp to start some sort of tech startup when you have a business experience that many tech founders would love... Getting a boot camp done, just gives a jack of all trades master of none vibes, because people that would respect it more will be business side, and tech people will value your experience more then the certification. \n\nMy go to Tech stack for anything web related within the **Javascript / Typescript ecosystem:** \n\n* **React**\n* **Next.JS**\n* **CLERK** for Authentication and profiling\n* Was using **planet scale** for Database but no longer offering free tiers\n* **Vercel** for easy hosting\n\n  \nTLDR: Online resources much cheaper, less time intensive. You will always need them with or without a degree. Invest into the startup while learning online. Build easily with React, Next.JS, and CLERK...",

They told me to call if I bled or was in pain, and when I did they literally *chuckled* and said, well if it‚Äôs as bad as you say then just go to the ER I guess. On my ultrasound follow up my IUD looked crooked and they were like, it‚Äôll fall into place. My next gyno appt a year later it was literally almost falling out.

I can‚Äôt remember exactly how much it cost, but I think it was something like $130 (before tip) to go from the airport to Castle Rock in zero traffic. Literally 2x more than an Uber, it was just taking too long to connect to an Uber and I was impatient. But I‚Äôll wait as long as it takes next time to avoid that rip off again.",

      "Thank you for sharing, this makes sense that is not regulated based on my experience. On a busier night, (many delayed flights landing at once) I was met with chaos and many arguments down that taxi line. Ubers were just insane going over $150 estimates and the taxis were negotiating hard to get 2-4 DIFFERENT travelers into their van, still trying to charge the full prices of 80-100$ without discounting the fact that they had made it a taxi-carpool. I‚Äôve had one good experience with them and it was fine , negotiated set price was only slightly more expensive than uber which was backed up at the time . I think the rule is try to get uber/lyft but if not just negotiate a fair set price with these Wild West ‚Äútaxi‚Äù drivers‚Ä¶ in their old vans that never turn on a real ‚Äúmeter.‚Äù",

      "I have no answers, but I‚Äôm interested in seeing the replies. My neighborhood has lots of these properties, but the numbers never made sense to me either. They seem too expensive for the people who qualify. The only people I know personally that bought through the program don‚Äôt have W2 jobs (cab/Uber drivers), so I assume this works best for people who can manipulate their income on paper.¬†",
      "Sounds like it would be easier for someone to qualify if there wasn‚Äôt a $545/month HOA fee. Seems like the program might not have considered what HOA fees might do. Seems like you‚Äôre in a bit of a pickle trying to sell, I‚Äôm sorry.",
      "It's basically for people who can figure out some way to scam the system. For example, get a higher paying job to save money for the down-payment or inherit money, then a lower-paying job to qualify, then switch back to a higher paying job once the contract is signed to be able to afford it. Everyone I know who took advantage of these programs had some way to manipulate their income on paper while actually having a different income. I don't blame them for doing that because the requirements are set up to be impossible, but it kind of defeats the point of having these programs.",
      "Are you saying HOA dues or Condo dues? Does it include utilities or just ground maintenance and snow removal?\n\nAlso, I‚Äôm a lender that just moved here from the east coast. I‚Äôve never heard of an ‚Äúaffordable housing ownership program‚Äù requiring 20% down. Was that a requirement or only being put down to qualify? That‚Äôs regular conventional financing with no MI. \n\nThis does NOT seem like a good deal‚Ä¶",
      "I‚Äôm curious where you‚Äôre seeing the requirement that it be 35% of take home pay.¬†\n\nI know that the city has a number of different affordability covenants, which all have different requirements (and problems) but typically the cap would be 35% of gross income.¬†\n\n[See here](https://www.denvergov.org/Government/Agencies-Departments-Offices/Agencies-Departments-Offices-Directory/Department-of-Housing-Stability/Resident-Resources/Affordable-Home-Ownership)\n\n‚ÄúThe monthly housing payment expense must be more than 35% (FEHR) of the household‚Äôs total income.‚Äù\n\nUsing your example above monthly gross pay at an $89K salary is $7,416. Multiply that by 35% and you have a max housing payment of $2,595, which is more than the mortgage + HOA of $2,150 in your example.\n\nIf your covenant specifically says 35% of take home pay, that‚Äôs definitely a problem! And probably one I‚Äôd elevate to city staff or yoir council person.",
      "I am under this program and it made complete sense when I purchased in 2020. If you can save up for the down payment, it is way better than paying the apartment prices, which are typically more. Only thing you would worry about is if something breaks. BUT, I am also a super low interest rates.",
      "1. I think HOA fees are outrageous for some townhomes. For a first time buyer looking for a sub 400k home to build equity that at least holds me back on those properties.\n2. It sucks making too much money to qualify for any affordable housing program (80-90k). But on the other side it seems impossible to try to save an and buy a house.",
      "I tried to get one of these homes and ultimately couldn't. My income was within the limit, but I would have needed a way bigger down payment for the numbers to line up correctly.",
      "I qualified only $500 over the bare minimum to get a 1 bedroom condo and it was the best decision I've ever made in Denver. The condo was actually affordable and was the cheapest property sold in Denver since 2021. My neighbors are all pretty chill and most are really grateful to move on from Denver slumlords. It's a great program and it fills up easily even though a lot of people on reddit might not qualify. The real problem is that they'll probably never build sub 200k condos again.",
      "I work in the affordable housing market.\n\nThe current interest rate is a real killer. Though we offer lower than current, we still have to offer a decent interest rate.\n\nWhy? We sell our affordable mortgages to CHFA and other banks to then use that capital to purchase more property to build more affordable homes.\n\nCHFA and banks REQUIRE a certain interest rate to make purchasing the mortgage worth it over the life of the mortgage.\n\nWe also receive government (city, state and fed) grants to help subsidize these homes (selling a $500k home for only $350k) and they require that 35% of monthly income. So even though a homeowner is will to pay 38% we can‚Äôt sell it to them at the affordable rate.",
      "I was able to snag a townhouse in the HOST program last year but it wasn‚Äôt easy. While my income qualified, rising interest rates meant that I was getting priced out of the program and I could only afford one of the cheaper units (mine was built in 2008/2009). Also, each townhouse that went on the market would receive 20-30 offers that were almost exactly the same so it took a year and a half for me to have an offer get accepted. I can‚Äôt remember how many offers I submitted but it felt like a lot. Sellers would find sketchy ways to get around the resale price that the city would set for them by excluding certain items from the sale like the fridge or washer/dryer and asking extra money for that. I lost out on one townhouse where the winning bid offered $25k for the seller‚Äôs hideous furniture. Also, the city was letting Elevation Community Land Trust pilfer homes from the HOST program, making them less affordable in the process, and I lost out on several homes because of that. ECLT was making all cash offers that pretty no one can compete with. I complained to the city about that but I‚Äôm not sure if they‚Äôre still letting ECLT buy homes from the program.¬†"

      "Agree with others on ways to reduce cost that are reasonable.\n\nGC it yourself, do drawings, permits, revisions and inspections.\n\nHire a good framer and supply him a dumpster for disposal, bonus if he also drywalls.\n\nBy saying electrical and plumbing are installed, Iam guessing this is just saying there are ceiling runs for electric and water to the room locations you want finished per your desired floor plan? You still need an electrician to come in for outlets, lights, etc and a plumber for connecting water fixtures, toilet, shower pan\n\nFind a handyman who can do baseboards, doors, trim and your tile, shower door and vanity work\n\nDo insulation yourself with rockwool or something\n\nGet good quailty inexpensive flooring from sloans \n\nPaint it yourself.",

You already have rough-in for your bar or does that need to be added.  \n\nFor basic finishes and someone else doing this you should expect no less than $75/sqft in Denver metro.  If you can play GC and oversee trade you can probably get to $50/sqft.",
      "I had my basement finished in a similar fashion two years ago and 5 quotes came in between 60k and 200k. That budget is not realistic unless you do a lot of it yourself.",
      "I cant help with much, but i can say the tile work for the bathroom/shower is going to eat into more of the budget than youll realize. A good idea of tile budget should be about $5-6/sqft for material and about the same $5-6/sqft for labor. You can find tile for cheaper, but keep in mind you'll still need thinset (1 bag will get you 40sqft), caulk, and transition strips, waterproofing agent, mesh tape for the corners. \n\nAs far as flooring for the rest, id budget about 2-3sqft for material, and about about $2.50sqft for labor (if you go the LVT route)",

If you're contracting out that work then that money will go pretty quickly.

      "You probably could do it if you contract everything yourself and even do some work. You could also easily exceed 30k on a nice bathroom alone",
      "When you say electrical and plumbing, you are probably just talking about a sub panel and the drain plumbing, right? Maybe the laundry area is completely done and being used, just in an unfinished basement?\n\n$30k will barely get it done doing all the work yourself with minimal finishes. \n\nYou are looking at about $70-100k depending on finishes and quality of contractor.",
      "The best place for referrals on GCs is nextdoor.  GCs typically work in a pretty small area, they won't drive halfway across the city for a basement job.  \n\nI think your budget is too small by half.  2x4s and drywall cost twice what they did 4 years ago."

      "Article by Alex Edwards is not paywalled.\n\n  \n\"The Denver City Council unanimously approved a funding agreement worth $3.1 million to assist the Colorado Coalition for the Homeless with rehabilitating 107 hotel rooms into studio apartments.¬†\n\nThe rooms being rehabilitated sit within the former Clarion Hotel at 200 W. 48th Ave. The Colorado Coalition for the Homeless will add services geared towards assisting homeless people and those at risk of becoming homeless. Once completed, the property will be known as Renewal Village.\n\nThe Clarion Hotel is the third hotel the city has converted to a shelter as part of an ongoing strategy to address homelessness in Denver. The city's Department of Housing Stability (HOST) has worked to convert other hotels, located at 3737 Quebec St. and 3500 Park Avenue West, according to spokesperson Derek Woodbury.\"",

Since you were remote, that'll probably be CO, but could be TX. When you go to file online it'll tell you if you have wages here.\n\nPrepare for 6-8 weeks processing time. You'll want to request payment while your claim is pending so you can be back paid, but it will likely take up to 8 weeks.\n\nYou can quit or be discharged and still get UI in CO, but it depends on the circumstances. In your situation, it's not really going to matter what your employer labels the separation as. A real person is going to review your case and the substantive facts on file are going to be their main focus not just \"quit vs fired\".\n\nYou'll want to wait all the way up until you truly can't work there anymore to separate from employment. They'll likely say you quit by refusing to transfer which is fine. You want to work until the end so there's no question that the demand to transfer was the cause of your separation.\n\nWhen you complete your UI paperwork, you'll want to explain what you've said above about always working remotely and the request to transfer to TX being unreasonable. \n\nYou could be allowed due to a \"substantial change in working conditions\" that was also less favorable to you. So those are the big points you'll want to prove when you complete your application.\n\nWatch out for follow-up contacts from the UI office because your processor will only make one attempt to reach you and you'll be SOL if you miss their deadline to respond. That contact could be around that 6-8 week mark so keep checking in.\n\nAssuming you made $65k or more in the last year and a half, you'd be looking at $781/week in benefits pre-tax. Even if you are denied, it's always worth appealing which has its own separate process.\n\nAnd if they have you sign an agreement for severance, take it! CO won't penalize you for it.

Feeding hummingbirds can change their migration patterns. They can and do rely on non-native food sources. If you are going to feed hummingbirds, which personally I think is great, you should ask yourself, are you willing to make sure you're feeding them with the right food, using the right style of feeder, that you're regularly cleaning the feeders out and replenishing them, and are you going to do this year in and year out in a consistent manner? IMO most people are not looking for another maintenance item to do every couple weeks, but maybe you're ready to take this on long term.

They are around, just not in clouds like they are in Castle Rock, Golden, mountains, etc.\n\nMigration we tend to see more species, though. Black-chinned, Calliope, Rufous are the other three that should be expected; others may drop through at times though not in any reliable patterns.",

So for the upper right-ish quadrant (this is probably more like 20% and not 25% of the city) you have 2500 intersections. Times that by 4 and you get 10000 intersections. And roughly 10000 manholes. Double that maybe if there is one per side of the block? And triple that if it‚Äôs counting storm drain covers too. Would be interesting to know for sure the answer. Def a hard interview question without some rather good knowledge of the city and infrastructure. The tire question is much easier to reason out.",

      "OK, so the conference is taking place in Estes Park. That's ~120 km from Denver International Airport, so you will need to comb the web for transportation to/from Estes Park and the airport. I would suggest checking with other attendees to see if someone has chartered a van or bus from the airport that might work for you. The only public transit I'm aware of that goes between Denver and Estes Park is the Bustang, but it's seasonal and probably won't start running until the end of May. And a glance at commercial shuttles from Denver International Airport shows a round trip to Estes Park is US $135. Keep in mind that Estes Park from Denver is like going from Dublin Airport to somewhere like Cavan‚Äîexcept Cavan is nearly twice the population of Estes Park and Colorado hasn't any serious public transport.  \n  \nEstes Park is a tourist town and the gateway to Rocky Mountain National Park, one of the most-visited national parks on the planet (not quite Yellowstone, but almost as heavily visited). So that means not many places in town will be available for cheap lodging: the tourist industry tends to either regulate those out or make them expensive. You might see if the local YMCA has lodging available since the one in Estes Park is pretty good and probably offers some kind of shuttle service into town (it's 8-9 km from the YMCA to the venue). The nearest university is nearly 70 km away and again, no public transit. Estes Park is truly \"in\" the mountains and is a small town, and if memory serves, they don't even have free, local shuttle buses like many tourist towns.  \n  \nCamping might be an option since there are local campgrounds in and around town, for which there is a fee. Those campgrounds are oriented toward caravans and the like‚Äînot tent sleeping‚Äîbut are still serviceable. But here's the warning: Estes park is 2300 m above sea level and that means May will still have wintry weather now and then. As in, be prepared for snow and temperatures that could reach -10 C at night. Personally, I've scraped frost off my tent in Estes Park in mid June, meaning the overnight was below zero C‚Äînothing like getting frozen hands trying to pack a tent fly that's still got ice in it!",
      "So I looked up this years conference, it appears to be in Estes Park?\n\nIf so, that is an hour and a half drive from Denver on a good day. Three hours round trip.

      "Check out the Denver Tech Social Club and the Colorado Tech Community discords. No promises but you might be able to stay at ours for a bit depending on if we're already having someone stay over to look after the cats while we're away - I'm going back home to Birmingham around that time (and coincidentally popping to Dublin to get my Irish citizenship stuff sorted). I'll DM you if that's a possibility.\n\nIn the summer I think there's (usually) a Bustang service (basically just a regional bus) to Estes/Rocky that might be handy for you.",
      "If the conference is in Estes park, you‚Äôre much better off trying to crash with some college or grad students in Boulder than in Denver. It‚Äôs about half the distance! Transportation will still be tough, but there may be Boulder students going as well that you could carpool with.",

      "The road from Bear Creek Rd. north at Idledale (Grapevine) is a small dirt road with a 10-15mph speed limit and that dumps you out in Genesee which has fairly wide shoulders and a lot of pedestrian traffic.  Genesee is also a bit higher than Evergreen.  Then at least you're only on Bear Creek for a little bit aside from Lair of the Bear, and mostly the Morrison bit which is heavily patrolled for speeders.",
      "From Golden, take Chimney Gulch trail to Beaver Brook Trail, all the way up. This puts you at the Chief Hosa exit on I70. There's a bike path here on the north side of the highway that goes to the Evergreen Parkway exit. Use Alltrails to map these out if you're unfamiliar with the area."

Remember too that you're likely going to need bindings mounted which can take a day or two, so don't plan on just swinging by somewhere on the drive up and walking out with useable skis.\n\nI like Powder7, you can order online and have the bindings mounted before you arrive to pick up.

That said, this is not far from trying to trademark \"kimchi\" or something that's been around forever, I don't get it. Seems way out of line.\n\n  \nI have been a fan of Chang's cooking and restaurants for a while, but I have noticed his recent tend toward commercialization and hawking products/dry goods instead of running restaurants. In particular, my favorite was his Michelin star rated spot \"Ko\" that was formerly run by the great chef Sean Alex Gray and served what are now regarded as \"haute\" classics like shaved foie gras with ice cream or potato chips with caviar and poached egg. I really liked that place and was sad to hear it closed. Specifically, I heard they closed it with maybe not even a week or 2's notice for staff.

Whatever happened wasn't okay as you were a child. Are you after money or retribution(wanting them to be imprisoned?) It's going to be difficult to prove this now that you're 21 and will be quite costly to do. If it's money that you're primarily after I think you would have a lot better outcome if you secure your inheritance/trust fund(assuming they're wealthy wealthy) and then go more of a distant relationship route than suing them in court. \n\nNot sure about your situation, but suing another person is a massive undertaking and will likely alienate siblings, aunts/uncles, grandparents, cousins, family friends etc as they'll be in a way forced to pick sides and unfortunately its often not in the person bringing on the lawsuits favor because they're seen as the one initiating and causing the drama. I grew up in a rather affluent family and have seen similar situations happen with family friends and it never ends up working out for really anyone whatsoever in the scenario. I'd urge you to really research how it played out for others (I assume youtube you'll be able to find ppl telling their story) and maybe talk to other family members and see where they stand with all of it.\n\n Also getting a good idea of what your families longterm plan is for their wealth as maybe you have a significant sum of money coming your way at 27(age most trusts initially pay out) that by suing your parents you'd end up causing a lot of harm to your mental health and end up getting removed from any inheritance etc. Do your parents still support you financially at the moment? If so that is somehting to really consider as you likely would get cut off by initiating something like this.

The Sun analyzed ambulance trips transporting skiers and snowboarders from resorts to trauma centers.

      "Landlords would not be prohibited under House Bill 1098 from raising rent from one lease period to the next, as long as it‚Äôs not ‚Äúretaliatory‚Äù in a manner meant to subvert the measure.\n\nJesus this is just asking for litigation costs to increase, define a freaking number or benchmark or leave it out.",
      "The 90 day written notice part of this isn't getting a lot of news but it is massive - 30 days is simply not enough time to find the resources for finding an apartment &amp; coming up with the first/last/security &amp; moving.",
      "Genuine question here. What is stopping landlords from writing a lease without a renewal clause? Saying this lease ends in 12-18-24 months and that‚Äôs it?",
      "So the government will do literally anything except actually make it easier to build new housing.",
      "So if it doesn't take affect until you have been in your unit for 12 months then it seems like landlords could still not renew on a first year lease.",
      "This is a virtue signaling mess. All it will do is disincentivize people to rent to lower income tenants.     If I was a landlord I would rather a unit sit vacant than to let in a troublesome tenant I may never get rid of.  The only part I agree with is the 90 notice to vacate. I‚Äôm not sure why they couldn‚Äôt just pass that as a stand alone bill.",
      "A feel good bill that actually changes almost nothing. Just pass a bill that requires 90 days of notice from landlords for non-renewal.",
      "This bill is a great way to get landlords to offset rising costs by... you guessed it... raising rent.",
      "So for everyone in here being flippant about how this is just landlords angry about nothing, that landlords don't do anything, that there are no risks involved to landlords for renting, and that this bill really isn't that bad, allow me to give you the perspective of someone who is both a landlord and a lawyer.\n\nI rent one single family home. It was the first home I ever owned, and when we purchased another home we decided to rent instead of selling it. Honestly, much of the reason was sentimental, and I thought it might be a good place to let my kids live when they went to college. I've never raised rent, even with the massive property tax increase I had to absorb. I also handle evictions and have seen how taxing it is on the finances of someone who has to evict a tenant, or even just begin to take the steps to evict a tenant when the tenant isn't paying rent, for example. Just imagine that you paid a $1,000+ monthly bill that someone promised you they'd pay you back for, and how much that would affect you when they didn't or when they were late getting you the money. Now imagine having to listen to people complain about how unfair it is that you can't tell them you're not loaning them money anymore because in their opinion they weren't severely late enough, or didn't otherwise cause you enough harm (again, in the opinion of someone not having to live through it). And at the end of the day, as someone who is deeply liberal, I don't like the government intruding on my property rights and telling me I have to let someone continue living in my home unless I meet some pre-approved reasons.\n\nI will very likely raise rent over this to help cover the increased risk that I'll have to deal with things I didn't have to worry about before, and not give any leeway to anyone who is late. Oftentimes you can see the beginnings of issues with tenants, and previously you could make the judgment call to not renew them to hopefully avoid a mess in the future. The fact that the legislature thinks I should have to deal with a ton of nonsense just to have the right to only put up with it *for an additional 90 days* is absurd. Tenants think this is good for them, but it isn't.",
      "A few thoughts (if Polis signs, which is debatable):\n\n* Will be interesting to see how courts interpret the ban on retaliatory rent increase in combination with the rent control ban.  Both are statutory, so the ban on retaliatory increases almost certainly wins out.  Someone will need to pay to find out, though.\n\n* Adding complexity to landlord/tenant relationships is good for lawyers.\n\n* Preventing landlords from removing a tenant at the end of the lease (and requiring them to continue to accept the tenancy) arguably amounts to an unconstitutional taking under the Supreme Court's recent decision in *Cedar Point Nursery v. Hassid*.  That should be fun litigation for the AG's office.",
      "This is what happens when your elected officials are entitled. A rental property is a business, just like any other business, should be allowed to say it no longer **wants** to do business with specific people (non renewal of a rental contract), for any purpose, after the terms of the contract have been fulfilled. I don't own a rental property yet but intend to build one before the end of 2025 on property I inherited. \n\nI'm hoping u/jaredpolis see's this as a major overstep of government powers and veto's it.",
      "Does the 90 day notice to vacate affect a month to month lease?",
      "while florida is moving in the right direction cracking down on squatters and people stealing the resources of hard working landlords, this state is going further down the tubes of winking at criminals and making it easy for deadbeats to live in places longer without recourse. **THIS** kind of garbage is what makes housing prices high.",
      "I‚Äôm going to raise the rent on my existing tenants because my risk is increasing. I have 2 rental properties. I‚Äôm not a huge corporation. The benefits have to outweigh the risks or I‚Äôm not going to do it. I‚Äôll sell the prop or try do Airbnb.\n\nEDIT: I haven‚Äôt raised rent on anyone since they‚Äôve moved in. I eat the rise in taxes and insurance annually. I pay the extra trash bill. The cost of finding a new tenant typically feels like an offset for messing with the rent for a good tenant. This is just pushing over the edge.",
      "This bill is insane. While I think everyone deserves protections this bill goes too far. Especially the carve out that says if a landlord wants to move a family member in, they must renew, if there is a similar unit nearby. So you want my family member to pay more instead of living in ‚Äúmy‚Äù property? That‚Äôs just fucking stupid. \n\nAlso, I didn‚Äôt see it in the article but if the LL is required to give 90 days, I hope they are requiring the T is required to give 90 days prior to a lease ending, but based on the last bill that was passed idt that‚Äôs true",
      "It probably will increase rents a little. I know people are saying landlords are already charging as much as they can, but consider that this doesn't just increase the 'risk' for landlords, it decreases risk for tenants (which is kind of the point of the bill).\n\nI used to live in San Francisco, which has rent control for older buildings, and no rent control for newer ones. I would have paid a higher rent for a rent controlled unit than for an equivalent non rent controlled one, because I valued the security of knowing my landlord couldn't raise my rent an arbitrary amount each year, and moving is expensive.\n\nA way that could manifest is that people with the means to buy a house may hold off longer because renting becomes less risky, which increases the demand in the rental market.",
      "90 days to vacate would be amazing! My current landlord (American Property Solutions) gave me less than 30 days and tried to insist I pay holdover rates while they drag their feet to get me a new lease. I had less than a week to decide if I was staying or going once they got it to me so I had to stay in their leaky moldy building.",
      "This just shifts the cost of the worst tenants to be paid by the best tenants.  It raises lawyer income dramatically and does nothing but make housing more expensive.  It is so much more complicated, less desirable to be a landlord and will decrease the units, especially single family houses available which will raise rents dramatically.  I don‚Äôt see how this is a win for anyone except the super liberal who fake like it‚Äôs ‚Äúfor your protection‚Äù but it‚Äôs for sure just a new tax in everything but name.  Shame on Polis for not seeing that this hurts housing and he needs to increase supply to lower prices.  What the hell are they waiting for?  Approve Additional dwelling units like Austin.  We need cheaper housing, not building in the renters paying for the people who are shitty tenants.",

But honestly, not sure it would even work due to the businesses in the area.  It is mostly serviced by hotels for airlines / quick layovers.  And the traffic is from the local residents / hotels / airport parking lots.",
      "Absolutely no.  Tower road, over there, is the ONLY non pay alternative to get to the airport. If there's an accident that shuts down Pena, you'd have to take the toll road.",
      "You put a lot of effort into this which I applaud, but my god you are focusing on an area that‚Äôs an absolute pile to live near lol. We live literally a couple blocks east of this and can‚Äôt wait to get out of this area. \n\nThere‚Äôs actually a decent amount of foot traffic on Tower but it‚Äôs usually just south of where you‚Äôre talking about here. It‚Äôs definitely going to grow with how much construction is going on, though. \n\nWhat you‚Äôre NOT seeing is how many people panhandle in this area. It‚Äôs been cleaned up a lot recently but around the holidays there were literally people at every intersection. They‚Äôre still at King Soopers and Sprouts constantly waiting outside with their baby strollers and kids playing on iPads. \n\nNot saying it‚Äôs a lost cause to try and beautify this little area, but it‚Äôs already setting itself up to be kinda bleh. There‚Äôs also ANOTHER gas station being built right in that area as well. So I‚Äôm sure that‚Äôll add to the mess.",

The tens of thousands of cars and semi‚Äôs that use that road won‚Äôt magically disappear.",
      "There's a reason people don't do foot or cycling traffic in this area, and it's not because of there being a lack of ability to do so.....",
      "Neat concept but I'm unsure if your design allows vehicles to cross Tower Road, similar to Pearl St. in Boulder. If not, I think that flexibility would need to be built in. Similarly, it looks like you have 61st blocked off. A lot of people who don't live near an A-Line station (myself included) rely on 61st to access the park-and-ride to get to the airport. I would keep 61st between Salida and Richfield open to cars, so folks can still transition to the parking lot from 60th (unless Panasonic Way could somehow be extended and cars could cross 61st that way).",
      "I like the idea but not the location.  Would be interested in seeing Denver try this in other denser locations first.  \n\nHaving traveled to many European cities - it's a night and day difference experiencing pedestrianized cities versus car heavy cities.  Manhattan is the best place in US to try this.  They just added congestion pricing but pedestrianization would be the ultimate solution.",
      "No.",
      "You sound like you would like Strong Towns",
      "Tower is a classic stroad. With most stroads, you generally have two options.\n\nThe first option is to turn it into a full on road. A road should have limited access with almost no driveways. There's plenty of right of way here for a boulevard concept in which you have a road down the center and parallel streets with access to businesses. Those parallel streets should be made to be usable by bicyclists and pedestrians. Something akin to the Dutch service streets: https://bicycledutch.wordpress.com/2012/05/21/dutch-service-streets-and-cycling/\n\nThe other option is to turn it into a street. Slow traffic way down, and narrow it way down. That's doable here, but because of the right of way width, I think the first option is a better choice. \n\nThis is not a dense neighborhood that making it pedestrianized and closed to vehicular traffic makes sense.",
      "Living near the area and biking a lot through GVR and painted prairie I think it would be really neat! People like to poo poo the area and while there are issues with pan handlers I think that will change in time. It‚Äôs an upcoming area."

      "&gt; In November, a group of pro-Palestine protesters demanded that all eighty people who had signed up be allowed to speak out against a conference in Denver organized by Jewish National Fund-USA.  \n‚ÄúWe had so many people, and I was very determined that every person was going to speak and have their opportunity to speak,‚Äù says Shannon Hoffman, a former council candidate who helped organize the November action.  \n  \n&gt; On February 12, so many people signed up to share their thoughts regarding a proposed ceasefire resolution, repeatedly interrupting after the public comment time had ended, that council ended up finishing its meeting remotely.  \n  \nWhat does the Gaza conflict have to do with Denver city council? What a waste of everyone's time, including the people speaking.",
      "&gt; How Does Public Comment Work Right Now in Denver?\n\n&gt;Denver isn't currently considering limiting public comment. Each Monday, there is a recess for thirty minutes of public comment at 5 p.m., between council‚Äôs sessions that start at 3:30 and 5:30 p.m. People sign up beforehand and can comment in person or online. How Does Public Comment Work Right Now in Denver?  \n  \nThose procedures exist because of efforts back in 2016 and 2020 by Councilman Paul Kashmann, who pushed for council to hear comments every week and have them televised, as the rest of council‚Äôs meetings were.¬† Previously, public comment was only allowed once a month and wasn‚Äôt televised.  \n  \n‚ÄúIt's fair to give the public an opportunity to address their elected officials as a body,‚Äù Kashmann says. ‚ÄúWe've got thirteen good people on city council, is my feeling. We've got a whole bunch of good folks working in the administration. But we've got about 750,000 people living in the City and County of Denver, and by not giving them a chance to speak, I think we're probably missing out on some good ideas.‚Äù  \n  \nIn 2022, council changed its rules to prioritize those who have never spoken at a meeting. It‚Äôs currently testing out a pilot program in which those under eighteen get priority at the first meeting of every month, too.  \n  \nEvery Denver councilmember with whom¬†*Westword*¬†spoke emphasized the value of public comment; several pointed out that open public comment doesn‚Äôt exist at other levels of government."

      "Not sure about Englewood but the movement in golden is so busy after work it's not worth going.",
      "I just canceled my Movement membership and will be joining DBC. \n\nMovement was too expensive for me given how I use it. I boulder, use the training room, and occasionally the treadmill. \n\nI pretty much only go to the baker gym which has a very limited bouldering area. It's proximity to my house makes it way easier to go in the middle of the work day, but when they announced that they would be closing the baker bouldering area for April I canceled my membership.\n\n  \nI think I would stay at Movement if they offered a cheaper membership for using just one location. I just feel like I'm paying for a lot of stuff that I'll never use and $102/month is pretty expensive for a gym. I also don't think the facilities are that great, at least not at the baker gym. Most of the treadmills are pretty worn down. They also don't have a sauna which I've heard the Oregon movement gyms have. \n\nI also think Movement oversells memberships. Even at 3PM the gym is too crowded. After 5 it's difficult to get a full workout in in just 1 hr.   \n  \nDon't know much about DBC but it's even closer to my house and it's cheaper so I'm gonna give it a try.",
      "Which part of town are you in? I‚Äôve been a member at both gyms. DBC used to have superior setting compared to Movement, but that has gone downhill in the past 1-2 years after their head setters left. The community aspect of DBC was better.\n\nDBC has lifting equipment at all their locations. The South location has the least equipment of their 3 gyms. If you‚Äôre just doing free weights and not specific machines, they have everything you need.\n\nMovement is a big gym, and if the social aspect is important to you, probably a bit harder to meet people. The setting varies depending on which location ‚Äî Baker has high quality sets, second is probably Englewood and Golden / RiNo are similar. They also just opened a Centennial location next to IKEA which IMO has the best lifting area of all their gyms. You‚Äôll also never run out of fresh routes to climb between all the locations in the area. \n\nMy opinion is that Movement has a bit more to offer, and the monthly price is reflective of that. Bonus being that they are in other states and if you travel to places where they have locations, that is a huge plus. The gyms are indeed busy, and if you can swing climbing during off hours, it‚Äôs a much better experience.",
      "DBC! Their 24hr membership makes life so much easier.",
      "I lifted regularly at DBC for a while. Pending what equipment you're after, they might be lacking, but I'm firmly of the opinion that barbells/squat rack/bumper plates and dumbbells are all you need, and theirs are in good condition. The 24 hr membership is great, and it's rarely crowded.\n\nThe only reason I would do Movement again is to get back into top rope/lead, or if I liked crowds.\n\nETA: I have spent time lifting at North and Central and will vouche for the equipment. I have climbed at all 3, and while south is small, I have enjoyed all 3 and continue to enjoy Central.",
      "I think movement is fine. The weight area is a bit plus, the different classes and meet ups are nice to have, not to mention the different options for gyms/climbing styles. \n\nI really think the route setting at Englewood has gone downhill over the last couple of months. They lost a couple of good setters, and I think some or the former  setters have been spending a lot of time getting Centennial up and running.",
      "I like The Spot.",
      "DBC. They have free weights at every gym, the setting is superior, it doesn't get as busy, and they have 24hr memberships which are very worth it.",
      "I can compare DBC central and movement englewood, have climbed at both alot over several years. \n\nDbc central is more old school setting. Thuggy moves, often shouldery that are more efficient to cut feet on. Their wall design is fine, but not great to smear on. The workout equipment is not extensive. It allows dogs. It's peak busy times are not as long as englewoods or as intense.  \n\nMovement englewood has more space and probably my favorite wall design in all of denver. There is more variety in setting, but I think their current setters lack creativity in the v8-11 range. Imo, DBC setters are better at making hard climbs out of complex/hard movements, Movements setters tend to rely on using worse holds. Movement has large workout area. No dogs allowed. The peak times at englewood have become absurd, bordering on a safety issue. I consider it unusable from 5-9pm M-R.",
      "DBC has no value in comparison. Setting, facilities, class offerings, just about everything is better at Movement and it's only marginally more expensive. I was at DBC for a year and didn't enjoy it at all. Just my opinion.",
      "Ubergrippen",
      "Which DBC location? South is really small, very little equipment, and the walls are smooth so you can‚Äôt really smear effectively. The walls are shorter than Movement though which helped me a lot with my fear of heights. We dropped our DBC membership and switched back to Movement when their sets started getting more difficult than the grade implied. That was over a year ago so not sure how they are now."

      "What gym are you going to? I froze my membership months ago but felt like golden‚Äôs routes weren‚Äôt that far from of typically. Baker‚Äôs lead wall was hit or miss - I‚Äôve been on some 12+s there that felt harder than climbs of the same grade outdoors. Also I‚Äôm not sure why you say you‚Äôre surprised to find jugs on a 5.10 - they‚Äôre all over 5.10s outside too. I mean Jesus I just did Sonic Youth on Sunday - that‚Äôs 5.13a and is almost entirely jugs.\n\nIn general the gym grades are gonna be softer on walls that allow TRing and at the lower grades for a number of reasons - and gym climbing in general will always be easier than outdoors. The routes are shorter. You can see every hold and have a pretty good idea exactly how good it will be before you ever leave the ground. Friction is generally excellent. You‚Äôll almost never find bad feet. Luckily the days are just about long enough for climbing after work to be feasible for most front rangers.",
      "I find indoor climbs to have much more variable grades than outside. Outside there is a broad consensus, however, inside has a small consensus of a handful of routesetters which creates a bit of a bubble sometimes. This bubble gets smaller when the grades go up, as fewer routesetters can climb the harder grades. The routesetters get to decide what is fair for the grade, not the people climbing it. It also boils down to experience. I'm more of an outdoor climber, so I find indoor climbing to often be harder than the grade outside, and I'm not alone in that. I have friends who climb 13 outdoors and find the 12-'s at Movement Golden harder than said 13's. And for bouldering the upper end of the grades (V8 and up) tend to have a +/- 2 grade difficulty around them. This is especially apparent at Englewood which has decently soft lower grades and a very inconsistent and often sandbagged range at the upper end. The best thing to do at the gym is just to climb what gives you some challenge and not think about the grades too much.",
      "just take the grade and subtract 1 and it's a decent ballpark relative to outdoor",
      "I‚Äôm actually a proponent of making the routes easier. Gets more people climbing and increases new comers to try harder and harder routes. If you want something insanely difficult go out side it my mentality. \n\nI‚Äôve always taken the approach that you‚Äôre training in a gym and pushing outside you want your training to be easier as you‚Äôll do many more climbs inside instead of outside. \n\nBut yes baker is usually easier than golden or centennial. I find the bouldering in RINO to be pretty hard",
      "I was at Golden last night but usually do Baker or RiNo. Golden routes are rated half a rating bellow similar Baker and RiNo routes. In NYC there is a more stark and well known pattern of ratings getting easier as you get further from outdoor climbing. The Palisades has no climbing areas so the you have to go north or west if the suburbs for outdoor climbing.",

The whole schtick is to steal the car/motorcycle, get it either torn down or moved. The best ways to do that are to immediately load it up, and move it elsewhere to either be sold (usually a different country if kept whole), or to another state to be torn apart.   \n  \nOf course, it could just be some local random thing.  \n  \nFor future, always keep a gps tracker in your vehicle (samsung/apple are fine, but you can get real ones for cheap online too...), and then, here is the hard part, try to talk to a detective at the police (yes, put in the police report, but then nag the shit out of them for a detective, and come with your GPS data). \n  \nDPS is....abysmal...at best.

      "Horrible Things Film Club, is hosting a free screening of Kiyoshi Kurosawa's 1997 Breakthrough Japanese Horror feature \"CURE\"\n\nA wave of gruesome murders is sweeping Tokyo. The only connection is a bloody X carved into the neck of each of the victims. In each case, the murderer is found near the victim and remembers nothing of the crime. Detective Takabe and psychologist Sakuma are called in to figure out the connection, but their investigation goes nowhere. An odd young man is arrested near the scene of the latest murder, who has a strange effect on everyone who comes into contact with him. Detective Takabe starts a series of interrogations to determine the man's connection with the killings.\n\nAs part of our ongoing series focused on Japanese Horror Cinema, on Thursday, April 11th, we'll screen this excellent film and host a post-screening discussion.\n\nThis Horrible Things Film Club screening event is free and open to the public. However, the first 25 people to RSVP using Eventbrite will receive a special event-attendee-only collectible.\n\n[RSVP via EVENTBRITE here.](https://www.eventbrite.com/e/cure-1997-free-screening-event-tickets-878647657797?aff=oddtdtcreator)",
      "Huh, a Metacritic score of 70. I was thinking this would be one of those movies with a 28 score, but the *LA Times* said, \"With its gift for infusing uneasiness into every frame, Kurosawa's moody, unnerving film continues to spook us even after the lights have gone on.\"",
      "What format will this be presented on? And just wondering if it‚Äôs a TV or Projector. Thank you!",

To the Denver Public Library children's library where we took a photo together of Flat Stanley reading his book. \n2. To the state capitol building. The folks there were super-accommodating and we got great photos in places tourists don't usually go. I also took him outside on the \"One Mile High\" step and took a photo of him there (blue painter's tape served me exceptionally well throughout this adventure--I taped him to everything, everywhere). \n3. Outside the Denver Art Museum where Stanley \"got caught up\" in the sweeping broom sculpture. \n4. Red Rocks and same day, Dinosaur Ridge--took pictures next to the footprints for scale. \n5. I needed a haircut, so we got a photo of Stanley in the barber's chair at Emily Griffith with a student \"cutting\" his hair. \n6. I was getting acupuncture at the time, so I got photos of Stanley getting the needle treatment, too (the practitioner's mom is an elementary school language arts teacher, so she was thrilled to participate). \n7. We went to Colorado Springs and took pictures at Garden of the Gods adn the Air Force Academy, but didn't make it to the Olympic Training Center. \n8. We went to the Denver Museum of Nature and Science and took some hilarious pictures with the T-Rex in the lobby and among the dioramas. \n9. I couldn't take him inside the US Mint, so I found a spot on the top floor of a nearby parking garage and took a picture of him with the loading dock in the background. \n10. We posed at Buffalo Bill's grave, at the DCPA, and at Coors Field (because the kid I was doing this for is a huge baseball fan).",

      "Yes it‚Äôs tough! If it‚Äôs part of the city‚Äôs affordable homeownership program then the income for a single person household is capped at something between like 60%-120%  of the area median income (depending on the specific property‚Äôs restriction). \n\nYou also won‚Äôt be approved for a loan for one of these unless your monthly payment is like 35% or less of your monthly income. So the potential buyer pool is very small. I‚Äôm not able to say if the program is effective or not but I know you have to be in the exact sweet spot of earning enough to be able to afford it but not too much to top out of eligibility.",
      "You're right. The monthly payment and the income cap doesn't make sense. However the people I've talked to about this exact topic say there's additional support to make the payments. To own a house in Denver, you either need to be broke or rich. Anything in between and you're out of luck.",
      "These units are actually really good for retirees. They usually have the ability to make a large down payment, see the HOA as a positive, but they are on a fixed income so having a small mortgage instead of renting is a great choice.",
      "If you don‚Äôt make $100k+ the 25-35% of income rule is a joke now.\n\nStick to it if you want but it seems quite conservative.",
      "It's not great but that's totally doable on a mediocre income. It won't be easy but it's not completely cost prohibitive. But you'd better have stable employment. Definitely couldn't do it at 35k though, that's absurd.\n\nedit: btw where is this $350k house?",

      "I have an affordable unit for sale in Denver rn. They gave me the max price to list it. 2B 1B 900sqft @$272k- renovated in 2017. \n\nIt is the base amount I paid plus 3.5% appreciation per year. Which, allegedly,  is less than market rate. \n\nI got it at a discount when I purchased and it takes 15 years to slide back to market rate. \n\nI‚Äôve had about 10-12 showings in the past few weeks and Zero interest. My unit is the worst in the building in the basement, bc that‚Äôs where the poors go. No one wants it. I‚Äôm now my investment is stuck in affordable housing and I make more than twice the qualification limit. I no longer want or need affordable housing and I‚Äôd like someone who needs it to use it. \n\nI want to sell it to someone in need of the ‚Äúdiscount‚Äù but it seems to already be at market rate and I still have 8 years of appreciation. \n\nThey also raised qualification from 80% AMI when I bought to 90% AMI and wages have gone way up. A couple can make up to $94k and still qualify, but they‚Äôd need a sizable downpayment to keep within the limit of their mortgage AND HOA being less than 35% of their monthly take home pay. \n\nI was in a tough spot when I bought it and it served its purpose. My plan was to own it for 5 years, but in Sept I‚Äôll have it for 7. I‚Äôve listed it twice. I‚Äôm really hoping it sells this time.",
      "Denver is a desirable place to live.\n\nBut it would be nice if there were some serious regulations made about owning multiple single family homes and renting them out and make it impossible to hide identities with shell corporations, or at least have people pursue them harder... but yeah, that's likely not going to happen because that's how a lot of wealthy people make their money / hide it or what they are doing to make it.  \nPlus, the government gets its money from taxes. Not many really want prices to go down. Historically, it almost never happens. \n\nIt stinks too, because home ownership is good for neighborhoods. I'm glad I didn't have to grow up around a bunch of houses being bought up and rented out like 4-6 unit buildings.\n\nBest you can do is keep getting desirable skills / experience and live frugally for a few years and save like crazy. If places like San Fran, NYC, London, and tons of cities in China and other places around the world have shown, it can and almost certainly will get worse.",
      "No but it is for Colorado.",
      "Without knowing exactly what you‚Äôre looking at it‚Äôs hard to know how they‚Äôre defining ‚Äúaffordable‚Äù but typically that‚Äôs a percentage of median income. One of the higher levels of affordable housing is usually ~80% of area median income. According to this [fact sheet](https://www.denvergov.org/files/assets/public/v/1/housing-stability/documents/2023-incomerent-limits/host-income-rent-limit-2023-mah.pdf) from the city, that‚Äôs about $80,000 for a 2 person household, which would be in line with your calculations. Yeah, that‚Äôs still a lot of money but it is technically ‚Äúaffordable‚Äù from the city‚Äôs definition. It‚Äôs definitely a factor of things being priced for dual income families and a relatively high median family income in the area.",
      "Absolutely not. There‚Äôs literally an ‚Äúaffordable‚Äù home in boulder county that can‚Äôt be sold because they ask more than a person can pay on the restricted income limits. It can never be sold again unless they change the income limits or the market crashes.",

      "Its not even the home prices for me, its these stupid HOAs asking for $500+/mo for a HOUSING DEVELOPMENT (not a condo). The house prices on top of it all just adds insult to injury. \n\nBut no $350k is bot ‚Äúaffordable‚Äù for the vast majority of people.",
      "Technically it is affordable. A 2 person partnership could afford it if both had full time minimum wage jobs. The hardest part would be for these two to save up a downpayment. The reality is that someone who makes a low wage but comes from a better off family will get a downpayment from their parents and swipe this from the people it was intended for.",
      "I am actually hoping to buy a place through affordable housing. My partner and I make 85000 combined working in education and non profit. I‚Äôve been trying to buy and keep thinking we must be some of the only people who could actually make it work. But my friend who lives in some told me it‚Äôs lots of medical students who apply and their parents give them cash down payments. Then they sell as soon as they graduate or finish residency.So even if you do qualify, rich people still game the system for their own benefit. It‚Äôs such a bummer. We are mostly concerned about our autistic son and want to make sure he has a place to live when he gets older. It‚Äôs tough out there!",

      "Generally, the pricing and income limits are based on 60-120% of HUDs AMIs, sized for the number of people who are expected to live in the house based on sq ft, # of bedrooms, and other factors. If you‚Äôre looking at a 3BR house, it‚Äôs likely priced to be affordable to a family of 4. Currently 100% AMI for a family of 4 in Denver Metro is [$130K](https://www.huduser.gov/portal/datasets/il/il2024/2024summary.odn?states=%24states%24&amp;data=2024&amp;inputname=METRO19740M19740*Denver-Aurora-Lakewood%2C+CO+MSA&amp;stname=%24stname%24&amp;statefp=99&amp;year=2024&amp;selection_type=hmfa). 30% of that is $3,250.¬†\n\nI am not arguing that pricing isn‚Äôt out of control, and I agree that affordable housing programs are not meeting the needs of everyone who wants to own a home in Denver.

      "How much higher are you willing to have your personal bill be in order to pay for this? \n\nRooftop solar has some advantages as you mention (reduced demand on transmission infrastructure and no transmission losses) but also higher costs because building and managing a ton of small unique projects is inherently more expensive than a single big project. In some cases, the benefits of rooftop may outweigh the costs, but in general building a lot of large scale solar will be essential to meet targets are the lowest cost possible.",

If people agreed, they got a set amount as a credit for a period of time. I remember them asking our household and the lack of a battery made me say no.\n\nSolar is *not* the problem. It's the fact that the loop goes back into the grid directly from the panels.",
      "99% of residential solar is grid tied. No power from the grid, no power generation from the inverters. You‚Äôd need battery backup. It‚Äôs way more cost effective for Xcel to build and manage large scale utility solar sites as well. If you‚Äôre a utility company serving almost 4 million customers with electricity and you‚Äôre trying to meet renewable goals you‚Äôre not going to be thinking of slapping up 5-8 kW residential rooftop systems. You‚Äôre thinking in megawatts or gigawatts. Besides, there‚Äôs plenty of residential solar companies in Colorado that are basically already doing this work for them. The only real benefit to Xcel doing this is that, in theory, the meter release and interconnection could happen faster than it currently does.",
      "So a handout to property owners? Not saying I'd be against it, but understand what you are saying. Also, to withstand the wind event that happened yesterday each home would also have to come with a battery...so $$$$.\n\nThe obvious issues with this is property rights. Are homeowner going to willingly put basically an easement on there roofs? Who pays if there is damage? Who pays for removal if there needs to be a new roof? Homeowners would have to pay market electric rates and the lease to own fees... It doesn't make much sense.",

There's more I could possibly do if I gave up my own lifestyle and lived in a minimalist one room apartment.\n\nI'd like every skyrise to have that 3M solar film on their windows feeding into batteries and the grid. I'd like to create walkable cities with rail lines running between. It's easy to solve all of our problems with everyone else's money. Unfortunately you can't get people and greed out of the equation.",

But if you choose to, your neighbor is responsible for 1/2 the cost.

They also wanted a short 5 foot installment.\n\nWe didn't really want that and wanted maximum privacy from them if possible and planned to just pay for what we wanted but they jumped the gun and informed us a replacement fence was scheduled asking for money on a crumbled invoice we found in our yard.\n\nWe didn't bother at that point and just let them do what they wanted. It's not perfect but we didn't have to pay and they were never very nice about it throughout the process.",

This is one of those things that is nice, when repairing or putting in a fence neighbors often share the cost to be neighborly. \n\nIf they don‚Äôt, you can still repair it at your expense on the property line. Or, If they don‚Äôt choose to share the cost, then you can erect a new fence entirely inside your property line. That means the fence is your property alone. \n\nThis also works the other way‚Äî if you don‚Äôt want to fix the fence, you don‚Äôt have to! And you don‚Äôt have to pay for it! If they want a fence, then they can repair it or put up a new fence on their own property.",

It‚Äôs most likely on your shared property line now, at least if it was done right in the first place. \n\nI‚Äôm personally against privacy fences because our neighbors that have one had their housebroken into BECAUSE the ‚Äúdoor knockers‚Äù could easily be hidden by the privacy fence and break in the back door. They‚Äôre also really ugly after getting blasted by the sprinklers. \n\nLots of folks live by the mantra ‚Äúfences make good neighbors‚Äù, but I prefer to actually socialize and be nice to my neighbors. So I guess it depends on your personality",
      "From what I read on r/legaladvice, the person that the fence posts face is the owner of the fence. Or if you build a fence, that has to face you. Probably best to talk with your neighbor. They may hate it too.¬†",
      "I don't see any statutes relating to residential fences in particular, and the laws about shared ownership appear particular to agricultural land. However, it's not unusual as a matter of common law for boundary fences to be treated as easements for the opposite side's property. That is, you'd have an easement (right to access) the the opposite side of the fence. Since the \"user\" of an easement is responsible for maintaining it, this creates a mutual responsibility for costs applicable to both sides.\n\nSo, the result is basically the same as the statute applicable to agricultural land, but you'd have to bring private action to enforce it."

Air speeds up high can get fast regularly so let's only look at the air low enough to interact with ground structures. How about a height of 40 meters? For the width let's say 40 km since that is about the distance from Centennial to Arvada. Wind speed we'll say 60 km per hour. That's about 40 mph and around what I saw reported. Gusts were higher but it was sometimes still too, so that can be about average. Duration I'll say 10 hours. This is only an order of magnitude estimate. ¬†¬†\n\n\n40 km * 0.04 km = 1.6 km^2\n\n\n¬†1.6 km^2 * 60 km/hr = 96 ~ 100 km^3 /hr\n\n\n¬†100 km^3 /hr *10 hr = 1000 km^3¬†of air¬† So about 1000 cubic km of air.¬†\n\n\nAt standard temperature and pressure there is 1.29 kg of air per m^3 so that is also 1.29E12 kg of air.",

      "I heard an explosion and ran outside to see the building next to mine engulfed in flames. As far as we know, everyone is accounted for thankfully. \n\nBefore the firefighters got there, 2 guys who are residents had the wherewithal to start kicking in people's doors on the other side of the building to make sure no one was in there. Then they went back and got people's pets out. They saved 2 dogs and 2 cats before the fire spread to that side.\n\nThey're experiencing chest pain from the smoke they inhaled when they rescued them. I cried when I thanked them, imagining if someone would've done that for my dog. The firefighters were able to get another cat out. I am crying thinking of my neighbors losing everything.\n\nAfter first seeing the fire‚Äîwhich had completely engulfed one apt immediately after the explosion‚Äîand confirming that 911 had already been called‚ÄîI ran back into my apt, grabbed my dog, put him in my car and moved it farther from the fire. I then ran back to my place and frantically threw what irreplaceable, sentimental things I could think of and basic necessities into a suitcase in case the fire spread to my building. I could hardly control my tears or my breath.\n\nI'm now realizing I need to get one of those stickers for my door that alerts firefighters and neighbors that I have a pet, in case anything like this were to ever happen to me. I need to have a \"go bag\" packed. I want to make a mental and even physical list of the things I would grab if I only had minutes.\n\nAs of yet, we don't know what the explosion was that started the fire. We were all standing outside asking our neighbors if there's anything we can do‚Äîasking the firefighters for clarity on the situation, giving accounts and sharing videos with the cops.\n\nEverything smelled like smoke. Nobody could get their cars out bc of all the firetrucks and ambulances and cop cars blocking the entrance to our parking lots.\n\nI'm shaken and devastated for my neighbors. I'm in awe of the 2 neighbors who risked their lives to warn and save others.\n\nEleven hours after the fire started, they were still spraying down the building.",

      "Progressive, queer Catholic here.¬† Unfortunately the hierarchy in the archdiocese of Denver is really unfriendly to the progressive side of the Church. MPB used to be more chill and progressive. Then 3-4 years ago, the archbishop moved the pastor Fr Pat (who was there from when I was in second grade) to Holy Family and assigned a brand new young priest there who was a really poor fit for the community and it kind of fractured. St Ignatius used to be good but the Jesuits couldn‚Äôt staff them any more and the new order of priests is very conservative. I no longer live in Denver (moved for grad school) but per my mom it‚Äôs pretty much Holy Family or going to mass at Regis University these days. She watches mass virtually a lot and gets her spiritual fulfillment volunteering with the Ignatians.¬†\n\nEdit: and yes, Archbishop Aquila is a nut, and a lot of this is because of him. ¬†",

      "The Jefferson center for mental health has a sliding scale that can be as low as $5/visit. They also have crisis center and walk in clinic that do not have a cost!",
      "Ask your school! Often times there are opportunities for free counseling/some resources. I wish you the best, I hope you feel less pain and stress soon!",
      "There are some resources in Denver that can help. Colorado Crisis Services have free 24 hour walk in services if you are in an immediate crisis. They also have a number. This is their website: https://coloradocrisisservices.org \n\nThere is also Wellpower, which offers mental health services: https://www.wellpower.org/access-services/ They have case managers that may be able to help you navigate the medical system around your mental health needs.\n\nAs an international student you would likely not be eligible for Medicaid. Colorado has a separate program called Behavioral Health Administration (BHA) that may cover some of the expenses associated with treatment.\n\nLastly, your student clinic may have affordable or sliding scale treatment. I hope this information is helpful.",
      "So probably the best treatment is **counseling** or **\"talk therapy.\"** I agree with the other commentors that your school is the first place to look for a therapist. Be aware that there may be limits on how long they can continue to see you. Also, talk therapy can feel awkward at first, especially for non-natives, for whom English might be a second language, or who might not be used to talking openly with, for instance, a stranger or a younger woman. You may have to try to get over your initial discomfort. It will pay off greatly.\n\nAnother thing to consider is **medication**. Your school will have a health clinic that may be able to prescribe antidepressant drugs for you, if they're appropriate and if you are willing to try them. They are quite cheap, fairly effective and (here's the important thing) have relatively mild side effects.\n\nYou should also do some **self care**. Here are some self-care tips for depression.  \n[https://psychcentral.com/depression/self-care-for-depression](https://psychcentral.com/depression/self-care-for-depression)\n\nOne particularly effective approach is **journaling** (writing in a diary), but it has to be a particular kind of journaling. That article explains it, but there are some excellent books just about journaling, like Louise Desalvo's \"Writing as a Way of Healing.\"\n\nAnother effective measure is **exercise**. Just walking is enough. Do it every day, rain or shine.\n\nAnd there is a particular theraputic approach called \"**Acceptance and Commitment Therapy**\" or \"ACT.\" (It's a kind of updated version of cognitive behavioral therapy, which is considered the gold standard by insurance companies.) It can be done alone with a workbook, though having a human therapist do it with you is probably better. On the other hand, the book is cheap and you can work on it whenever you want.  \n[https://www.amazon.com/Mindfulness-Acceptance-Workbook-Depression-Commitment/dp/1626258457](https://www.amazon.com/Mindfulness-Acceptance-Workbook-Depression-Commitment/dp/1626258457)\n\nLastly, I can tell you what DOESN'T work: trying to \"just snap out of it\" or \"think happy thoughts.\" Depression is a serious medical condition. Recovering will take effort and maybe doing things differently than you used to.\n\nGood luck!",
      "If you're a student at University, they should provide some free treatment at the school counseling center. CU Denver has a sliding scale and you don't have to be a student there. https://www.ucdenver.edu/counseling-center. Other universities will usually have a community counseling center as well for masters level students to get training. It's under close supervision. Although it may not feel like it right now but things will get better, hang in there.",

      "This article is incorrect, lane SPLITTING is not allowed, only lane filtering. Stay safe out there fellow riders.\n\nSource (the bill): https://leg.colorado.gov/bills/sb24-079\nNotice how the part about splitting was crossed out.",
      "I'm guilty of lane FILTERING before this law was passed, but am very careful when choosing when/where to do it. Really when I'm at an intersection/light that I cross often and am aware of the amount of traffic and distracted drivers. \n\nI commute up and down federal mostly, as well as Sante Fe and Sheridan. All roads in which traffic reaches 40+ mph with lots of stop lights and people on their phones. Given enough space and time, I make my way to the front to avoid getting smoked from behind. \n\nThere are plenty of squid riders that give us a bad name and I won't try and convince anyone they aren't in the wrong, but when you're at a stop light on a motorcycle and see EVERY SINGLE driver on their phone, it's a reality most people don't know they're living in. I'll do whatever it takes to keep myself out of harms way",

      "When I had my bike in California, I was a huge fan of lane splitting. It's so much safer for the rider but only if the other drivers are used to it (like California drivers are). Getting rear ended at a red light is one of the most dangerous accidents for riders and riding up to the front helps with that. My concern is that very little drivers will look out for this.",
      "Some of y‚Äôall need to talk to a therapist about these anger issues going on here",
      "Drivers can‚Äôt even merge here correctly. How are they going to deal with this?",
      "That‚Äôs awesome. This is safer for motorcycles and will reduce traffic. Win-win",
      "Good. This is significantly safer for motorcyclists. Anyone opposed to this needs to do some research.",
      "As a 45+ yr motorcyclist, I have been asking for this and encouraging it for many, many years. Over the years, I have had multiple close calls from autos that didn't notice the bike between them and the car in front while coming to stops. And I have known people hit, maimed and killed the same way. There are riding techniques to help create escape routes, but filtering and slow speed splitting lets you out of that danger zone entirely. \n\nAnd now I'm not sure I will do it even though it's legal because of asshats like a select few in this comment section. I'm not immune to road rage, but I can tell that there are a few commenting here that WILL be the person butthurt about bikes filtering. Who WILL attempt to pinch the lanes down to endanger riders performing legal activities. Who WILL be attempting to open doors in traffic to injure or kill riders riding legally. They don't realize that these actions are attempted murder on a rider. \n\nHelmets on, armor on, stay strapped. Eventually, someone will die by these peoples hands and responsible riders will be the victims because someone who has to be first can't keep their ego in check.",

I'm not doing wheelies or burnouts but I've been knocked off my bike enough times to know I don't want to be sitting in traffic with just a prayer that the driver coming up on me is paying attention.",
      "Don't ride....and this still doesn't bother me.  It's not permission to do 90 weaving in and out of traffic.  That's illegal.  You know what else is?  The constant fucking danger of phone addicts that DON'T ride motorcycles.  Probably the majority in this sub.  That's the obvious and increasing problem on the roads.",

      "How many days before some dumbass who doesn't know the law intentionally kills or injures a biker out of road rage",
      "You all need to settle down in your cars. Bikes are not going to cause you any problems, let them pass",
      "As a motorcyclist, it's about time reason prevailed. This is a safety issue for motorcyclists - one of the most common ways to die on a motorbike is being rear ended at a stop light. This also alleviates congestion by using road space more efficiently. Of course, there will be asshats on bikes that split lanes well above 15mph, and they are breaking the law and should be ticketed. This is not filtering and has no benefits to safety. My main fear with this new freedom is being on the receiving end of road rage, getting shot by some Karen who doesn't think it's fair. So please spread the word that lane filtering is perfectly legal and helps everyone. Thank you.\n\n\nEdit: downvotes are only confirming my fears, lol. Guys, study after study has been done on this. Lane filtering at stopped lights reduces road fatalities. This bill does not condone or allow lane splitting at speed.",
      "Fantastic.",
      "I moved to Nevada last year, and was shocked by the motorcycle culture here. I'd say there aren't that many more motorcyclists here but they act very entitled. Lane filtering is legal in California, so they think it is here too. It gets re-interpreted by riders, though, who think it means passing between cars in adjoining lanes at 85mph is fine. So there is a lot of passing on the right at a high rate of speed, which means they appear out of nowhere and often in your blind spot. I had one drop his bike behind me as I was doing a very simple return to the right lane after passing a slower moving car maneuver. He had an injury and totaled bike, but fortunately did not hit me. I spoke with the responding patrolman and he definitely didn't think I was at fault. \n\nIn short, you have to be more aware that motorcyclists can be in unexpected locations on the highway in places where lane-splitting is common. Check your right shoulder when merging (and always your left, obviously.)",
      "The bill as written only allows for filtering when cars are stopped which is good but allows it at 15mph which seems fast but we'll just have to see how it goes.\n\nMy main issue is that I don't like loud, fast things moving in and out of my blindspots while I'm in the car. I understand the motorcyclist arguments here but when I'm already trying to keep track of other cars, cyclists, and pedestrians it doesn't seem unreasonable of me to not want one of those obnoxiously loud bikes to suddenly go by driver window.",
      "This is just going to increase the people on motorcycles who weave in and out of cars on the highway while everyone is going 65+. I see it frequently already. It makes sense if, like the article states, cars are stopped or going below 15mph. But we all know that‚Äôs not going to be how this goes.",

Think about a boat in the ocean. Little waves and bumps are normal because the ocean isn‚Äôt perfectly smooth. The boat can handle it. It may rock back and forth a little bit and sometimes it gets uncomfortable, but it‚Äôs designed for that environment. In an airplane, the same applies‚Äîyou just can‚Äôt see the ocean. \n\nIf you‚Äôre on an airline like Southwest with open seating (or want advice for selecting seats later): the closer you are to the center of the wing, the less pronounced the turbulence will be. The wing absorbs the load and is the most stable part of the aircraft!\n\nSource: I‚Äôm a certified flight instructor and have helped many students get over a fear of the bumps.",

My neighborhood, Pinery Glen, was one of those neighborhoods. \n\nI was stuck in traffic that day coming back from Parker, and just on Parker road there were several accidents sans cops, people were running red lights and sitting in intersections when the lights turned green, and driving through neighborhoods like bats out of hell. It was just odd to not see any cops in a county and city where they always seemed pretty plentiful. \n\nOnce I got back to my neighborhood the situation was worse. People had decided to cut through our neighborhood to try to get to the back road to Castle Rock where I-25 was open again. People were behaving like it was mad Max. They ignored stop signs, drove up onto sidewalks to avoid other cars, and turned a two way two lane road that's access for two neighborhoods into a one way two lane road. \n\nI didn't call 911, but if anyone in my neighborhood did I wouldn't blame them.

Was in a similar situation as you, just worked on the car in a rented garage at apartments with the garage cracked (it was winter time)‚Ä¶ definitely sucks but there hasn‚Äôt really been a push for anything to change.",
      "Gearhead garage is closing?!? Ugh, that‚Äôs such a bummer. I was looking for a DIY garage a few weeks ago to do some work on my car and ended up doing it in a parking lot across the street. Had considered gearhead garage but it was just inconvenient enough to drive to the springs. Was looking forward to going there eventually because having a legit lift makes many tasks sooooo much easier.\n\nTo answer your question, I don‚Äôt have any leads either. I did a fair bit of research and basically came up with nothing. I have a few ideas, though:\n\n* Post on one of the Denver specific car enthusiast groups. There‚Äôs a lot of them. Someone might be willing to let you use their garage for a few hours in exchange for some beer as long as you‚Äôre not a weirdo.\n* It might be worth talking to Larimer St Garage. They probably don‚Äôt have the availability to rent the space out, but Joey and Mike are pretty well connected and might be able to give you some guidance on where to look. \n* If all else fails‚Ä¶ the parking lot across from my apartment has worked well enough for me and I doubt you‚Äôd have any issues working on your car there for a day on a weekend. No one has bothered me the last few times I‚Äôve worked there, I just make sure to stay on the edge of the lot on non-business days. Clean up well, etc. \n\nEdit: just saw you‚Äôre planning on doing transmission work so the last suggestion is likely not helpful.",

It's technically not allowed at mine, but I've never had an issue with working in my detached garage with the door cracked.

If you have a bunch of \"nosy\" Karen type staff at your apartment complex then it might be an issue¬†¬†\n\n\nAs a side-note, you can openly work on your car in broad daylight at any auto parts store (AutoZone, advanceauto, Oreilly, etc) parking lot and no one says anything usually, so that's also an option. Same thing at junkyard parking lots, whenever I make a parts run to the junkyard I see cars jacked up/on jack stands and people working on their car right there in the parking lot"

Maybe it‚Äôs just who I hang out with.\n\nEdit: as another aside - what is the expected lifespan of a stadium?  In the last year or two there has been talk of a new stadium here and at the time the talk started the stadium was just over 20\nyears old.  I looked up arrowhead stadium and it‚Äôs &gt; 50 years old so that makes more sense that it may be time for a new one‚Ä¶ but &lt;25 years old?",

It depends on the proposal. \n\nMy point is not that even this would get funding, only that the people of the Denver Area would still consider something as long as it wasn't just replace the stadium with another where all the gains went to billionaires. Something else would have to be on offer. \n\nAnd the main complaint with the National Western Stockshow Arena, was that not that we should never put in for an arena, but that there wasn't enough in the deal to make it good for the neighborhood and the city. That it was just for Stock Show Attendees and Shows put on there. That all the benefit went to a few, especially rich people. \n\nThe people of the Denver Area will not vote to just give another stadium to the Broncos with the benefits only going to the rich.

Might not happen due to the amount of land available, but it would be a pretty crazy entertainment district if you had NFL, NBA, NHL, and MLS in that area.",

      "[u/bzzzzzzlightyear](https://www.reddit.com/user/bzzzzzzlightyear/), assuming you're asking about things you need to do as a city resident, many people are caught off-guard by the requirement that residents shovel their sidewalk clear of snow within 24 hours after the snowfall stops. My neighbor got a warning followed by a ticket last year because they were out of town and didn't put a plan in place to get their sidewalk shoveled (like ask a neighbor). Also, many, but not all parts of the city have monthly street sweeping from April-November which mean every street in the affect area gets swept once/month. You'll know you're in one of these areas because a street sign will say parking is prohibited on the 3rd Thursday of the month for example. They will absolutely ticket your car if it's there before the street sweeper comes through on that day. Last time I got a ticket, it was $50. May have gone up. Now it's in my calendar so I don't miss it and several of my neighbors text reminders. It causes car shuffling to different blocks for a couple of days. Be warned that you should check the street signs when you visit other parts of the city!

      "‚ÄúIs Tracks getting louder?‚Äù No. The sound system at Tracks Denver hasn‚Äôt fundamentally changed since it opened. Things get ‚Äòrefreshed‚Äô as they age, but the design is the same and there isn‚Äôt a ton of room to add much more that would significantly change your perception. What you‚Äôre hearing is probably ReelWorks. So‚Ä¶\n\n‚ÄúIs ReelWorks getting louder?‚Äù Maybe. For many years ReelWorks was a variable event space that would change based on need. The main sound system was transformable (in a limited sort of way) to adapt to event size and shape. It primarily faced west (away from Tracks, the nightclub part of the block, in the center of the greater structure). A couple of years ago the space changed from being ‚Äúevent‚Äù (conferences, weddings, etcetera) driven (day) to more club focused (night), which included a large-ish revamp of the room and a semi-permanent stage on the western side of the building (along 35th St.) with the sound system facing east (away from the nearby residences). This included a reconfiguration of the sound system and a few more bassbins. That made it a bit louder in the low-end, but hopefully pushed more of the (sometimes really annoying) high-end away from homes. \n\nAnother consideration could be that sometimes promoters using the space like to bring in their own sound systems. The ‚Äúrave-y‚Äù crowds love to hear things like ‚Äúextra Funktion One sound!!1!1‚Äù on their fliers. Coupled with dense, cool air (in which sound travels more easily farther away), this could explain an increase in perceived loudness. \n\nTL;DR: Yeah, maybe. It could be louder, it could just be perception. You moved in next to a large entertainment space; you kinda have to expect that once in a while, yeah?",

      "Can you post a sketch of what you are wanting to do? I get the feeling that you are misreading the setback requirement. \n\nAs I understand it, \"75%\" is used to determine what is considered the front facade of the house. If you have a rectangular house, the front facade is obvious. If part of the house is staggered back, then you have to determine which facade (the one closest to the street or the part set back) constitutes 75% of the front. So if half the house is on one plane and the other half is set back, the facade you measure from is the back one. What you will be measuring is distance **C** shown on the site map on page 5.3-34.\n\n\"10'\" is the minimum distance C that you need to measure from that facade to the nearest wall on the shed. For most houses, this has no impact because the houses are much deeper than that.\n\nEdit: The purpose of this is basically to ensure that the shed or the garage is at least 10‚Äô from the front of your house. \n\nThere are however additional things that determine where the shed can end up:\n\n1. Front 65% vs. back 35%\n2. Distance from side property line/alley/street\n3. Distance from back property line/alley/street\n4. Other existing accessory structures\n5. etc.\n\nThe simplest way is to sketch what you want to do with approximate measurements to property lines and other structures and go talk to someone at the Permit Counter. You can schedule an appointment for Tuesday or Thursday morning here: [https://www.denvergov.org/naoa/](https://www.denvergov.org/naoa/) I see several slots open for this coming Tuesday.\n\nIf there are special circumstances that prevent you from abiding by all the limitations, you can file a request for a zoning variance (after your application is denied for a zoning violation). The board of adjustments that reviews the requests is made up of a bunch of folks that are pretty reasonable and who look for ways to make things work for the applicant.

      "Jamie Giellis, is that you?\n\n120 years ago, those old school trams were a huge advance over walking everywhere, or riding a carriage. In 2024, those old school trams which run in the street would be as slow or slower than the bus. Unlike the bus, it can't move around obstructions.\n\nPeople way over romanticize trams/streetcars and also misunderstand or exaggerate the reasons for their demise. Besides the speed, our old network's routes and its physical coverage of the metro area was minuscule. By resurrecting it, you get a less useful system than the current RTD network at a very high price tag - where is that money coming from? This would cost billions, in a city that can't afford to staff its rec centers or DMV.\n\nA modern tram system which is largely separate from car lanes and with modern stations, like what's common is midsized French cities, would probably be more useful, but that's essential (a better version of) our light rail system. Which we already have, and which we can't afford to expand. Further, light rail/modern grade separate tramways are good for cities with a smaller footprint, but it's really inappropriate for midsize or large American metro areas, we're far more sprawled out, and much bigger, than Bordeaux or Nantes. We should have used the commuter rail technology that the A-line uses (and gets up to 80 mph) for our whole network and also created far fewer stops to speed it up.\n\nI always appreciate a dreamer who wants to see public transit improve, but asking Chat GPT how to get support for a 120 year old outdated technology isn't going to solve our problems. Given our political and fiscal realities, we need to start by improving and expanding our bus system, and increasing the frequency and reliability of our existing light and commuter rail system. And that includes making our buses, trains and stations safer, and not tolerating them being treated as traveling, Snowpiercer-esque drug dens.\n\nNext realistic step is supporting and expanding the city of Denver's already well developed plans for a bus rapid transit system.",
      "A cute tramway for 16th street is just common sense. It would mostly have a dedicated lane, it gets heavy use, and it would just be better aesthetically. \n\nThe light rail is really the same technology just laid out differently for more of an long distance express service. The L is truly a streetcar, but being just one small line it doesn't get separate branding or rolling stock. With more local oriented light rail lines the L would be rebranded a tramway/streetcar. There is really no reason for a tramway completely separate from the light rail, but but also switching to Low Floor equipment would be smart for the entire system, and with enough local lines buying a fleet with a layout optimized for local service could be smart. \n\nFrom LoDo to 38th and Blake could also do well, and perhaps providing local service withing the proposed River mile development, a Broadway line, or a line in a neighborhood likely to see a lot of new development.",
      "It would be nice. But who is going to do all that work? I‚Äôm pretty busy",
      "The modern version is the BRT and it‚Äôs being built on colfax right now.¬†",
      "Also, in Denver, residents don‚Äôt seem to foster a culture that emboldens light rail staff. A handful of comments so far have been productive yet seemingly defeatist. I don‚Äôt see how this attitude  encourages ppl to work for our current and future light rail system(s).",
      "Did you get your answer out of chatgpt? The asterisks are a bit of a giveaway. \n\n  \nThe way to recreate the convenience of the tramway is to bolster bus service. Many routes like the 52, 15, 0, 12, etc go over old rail routes. While maybe trams could be rebuilt on high density routes like Colfax, its probably just out of the realm of possibility to redo tracks."

For electricians, the rates are $26.91 per hour for residential and $39.75 per hour for commercial.\n\n‚ÄúThe idea is that if the public is funding construction, and taxpayer dollars are being spent, the people working on that job should earn a dignified wage,‚Äù said Denver Labor executive director Matthew Fritz-Mauer.\n\n\n\nWHY IS THAT SO HARD FOR PEOPLE?",

It's not even close. Also agreeing to federal wage scales when this is a community project and not understanding what that meant. They committed to paying east coast union labor rates when the going rate for Denver crews is much much lower.\n\nThen they buried their head in the sand and kicked the can down the road hoping the issue would go away or the city would bail them out with an incorrect ruling.",

I am also a solo ringleader of this circus I call life! \n  I have not used a mover for personal use, but did have success hiring Seven Brothers Moving in Golden to move some huge flower pots for my customer. I was able to assist him to keep costs low, as each person will up the charge of the move. The business is small which I appreciate the attention to detail. I cannot recall the movers name, but his girlfriend Taylor works the office, and he does the heavy work!  They have assistants as needed as well for larger jobs. He was very non threatening and I felt comfortable the whole time.

I was without heat for the majority of the winter of 22-23 and I had no working AC because of roofing project the entire summer of 2022 and the portion of the summer I lived there in 2023.  I walked past my old apartment about six weeks after I moved out and the new resident definitely had a portable AC unit set up, so the unit was leased to someone else without the AC being fixed. \n\nI've seen other Reddit posts about similar situations at other complexes, namely The Dylan in RiNo.  I think a huge part of the problem is that most of the tenant protection laws in Colorado amount to a slap on the wrist for most large corporations.  The shortage of our housing also makes these big corporations shrug it off when they get called out.\n\nI moved out of Uptown Square in August 2023 and it took unit December to get my deposit back.

Trash rooms are disgusting. Tons of useless services that they tack on to your monthly bill. I was paying $1675 for a 1 br that felt like living in a box, but closer to $1800-$1900 with all of the fees. \n\nThere‚Äôs frequently dog poop in the hallways and all over the sidewalks. People leave their trash out in the hall because of the mandatory ‚Äútrash valet‚Äù service. \n\nAt one point my (then) bf and I had a joke about how one of the entrances to the building had to have a broken door handle at all times. \n\nI work from home and my car was broken into but I didn‚Äôt go down to the garage for a few days. When I went to the office to report it they said ‚Äúoh, we were wondering whose car it was.‚Äù Like you don‚Äôt have my plates on file and can give me a call? The staff also told me she hadn‚Äôt heard of any other cars getting broken into on the property. Later learned from another resident that was complete BS, her car had been broken into twice in the last month. They also barely swept up the broken glass. \n\nI also chose to live on the top floor because I‚Äôm sensitive to disruptive noises.

      "The major hurdle is plumbing installation (amongst a slew of other issues.) New kitchens and bathrooms cost so much to install, along with necessary venting and drain lines, that these buildings are probably better off as ‚Äúdorm style‚Äù housing, with a shared community kitchen and bathrooms per floor ‚Äî which is probably not allowed by current building codes.",
      "What's the alternative? Offices aren't coming back. Companies will pay lip service to return-to-office policies until their expensive leases are up, but over the next 5 to 10 years every company is going to do the office space calculation and decide to run a lean, less expensive, work-from-home shop.\n\nSo are we leaving the downtown of a major American City an office park ghost town or are we building up something people actually use?",
      "I won't but people will, even though a single room will probably cost $2500-3k a month.",
      "Is this a real question? Yes, of course people will because we have a shortage of housing here. The complaints about higher interest rates are kind of irrelevant.",
      "I have an ex who lives downtown in a converted apartment. Awkward design, but still a very nice place with floor to ceiling windows.\n\nThe downside is that it's rather far from a grocery store and it's inconvenient.",
      "In past decades, people converted department stores and warehouses and all kinds of other buildings to cool loft style apartments. This isn't much different. If the location is good, then there is money to be made operating apartments there.",
      "To get them up to residential code it‚Äôs basically a complete tear down. \n\nIt would be cheaper to buy land and start fresh. I don‚Äôt know why Reddit doesn‚Äôt understand this. It‚Äôs true.\n\nThey would have to change code laws, enforcement which would give Landlords a lot of power back which this sub would hate. \n\nThey could maybe do shared kitchen/bathroom thing and have people live dorm style but I‚Äôm not entirely sure if that would fly legally. \n\nAlso, people generally like to make a profit doing work, which isn‚Äôt possible in this situation without extreme subsidies from the government or a non profit.",

      "If I was twenty something and single, yes. If I get divorced tomorrow it would entirely be on the parking situation, as I have to drive to pick up overtime. \n\nMy wife works downtown and can‚Äôt even use her space heater without tripping a breaker. Residential conversation is going to take time, money and probably some tax dollars. The only other option commercial real estate has is crossing their finger and hoping a lot of AI server farms kick up in the next 5 years. A lot of commercial buildings will be going the way of the shopping mall.",
      "Does it include a private parking spot?",
      "I don't think people realize it's a normal cycle for a city to convert old businesses into residential buildings. Part of the whole \"exposed brick wall\" and \"original timber\" industrial condo trend is renovated businesses from the 1900's and even the 1800's. Though it's funny to think what modern office features will be trendy to have in your apartment in a few decades.",
      "The buildings are empty now. Convert them to apartments with grant money and rent them for 900/month. Affordable housing problem solved.",
      "Going to have to figure out what to do with all the large office buildings as people push to remote working as the new norm.",
      "Just throwing this out there because I have seen first hand what very low income housing looks like. We live in a nice neighborhood downtown. My neighbor has 8 people living in what should be a single family 5 bedroom house with 2 shared bathrooms and a shared kitchen. He charges between $250 and $400 a month. The police have been there at least 15 times since we've owned our house the past 6 years. The house has been raided by swat 2X, we've had 2 people OD, and had to have the ambulance come to administer narcann both times. There's constant fighting and arguments at all hours of the day/night. It's so awesome! Not. My point is the price point for rent will determin if you get people like my lovely neighbors or you get decent people who genuinely need a break on rent and working in an industry that doesn't pay enough to live in Denver central.",

Once you have those two things done you should be able to get on with a electrical contractor pretty easy. And with no money out of your pocket.

It's an open campus, they all come and go as they please, many times, he'll just stay home and do his classes online, and he's lucky if he gets five hours of homework a month. Not to mention, only 160 days of school here.\nIn my old HS in CT, the students there still average 3-4 hours a night of homework, full days of classes, and 180 days of school. \nWhen we first moved back out here in 2015,  his 3rd grade curriculum was essentially the same as his first grade one in CT. Honestly, the schools are a joke out here, but when you're living in a state with the third lowest property taxes in the country, and the teachers here all have second and third jobs because they couldn't afford to live otherwise, it's kind of obvious why things are the way they are.

If you can make it them feel like they are doing something good that they don't have to do? Many people love to help others in that way.\n\nThe reason why the Mayor's office is that they are more concerned with how the Mayor is viewed, less an immediate \"this is not my job, go away\" that one can often receive from lower people with less empowerment over the scope of their job.\n\nIt doesn't work all the time, and the hardest part is more often finding that real person, hence the swinging for the fences.But I do think it is more effective than working through the bureaucracy."

      "It's not needed, and RTD might not be the best agency since it doesn't extend west of Jeffco.\n\nI'd love it if Eldora frequency was increased, service to lookout mountain,  and red rocks was added. But RTD should have bigger priorities. The light rail has been unusable for about 5 years now with unreliability due to operator shortages and constant maintenance projects that have zero regard for how they impact users. That impacts people's ability to live without a car substantially more because it deals with something you might need daily.\n\nBustang/pegasus/snowstang is improving and gets you to the mountains, and most mountain towns served have surprisingly good transit service so they can ferry tourists around once there. All can be improved in terms of frequency and reliability, but it's very usable and cheap. I think improving those services will do more than some pass that offers minimal savings.",
      "I personally would be unlikely to use it, because when I go to the mountains it's rarely just an out-and-back to a common destination at a common time.\n\nBut... as the city has grown there are more and more people who don't go to the mountains as much, and (speculatively) maybe go mostly to the popular/common places. So there may be an audience for this. Is it enough to justify bus service? Maybe.\n\nOTOH, bussing people to any park is going to cause crowding issues, which are already a problem at most of them. Which sounds a bit gatekeepy, but it's also a real danger for places that are already being \"loved to death\".",

Get to Morrison a couple hours before ‚Äúdoors‚Äù, have a local meal, wander the paths, and catch a shuttle up to a show/event.  \n\nEven an all day hang on weekends would be cool.",

I think it would be great!\n\nWould it help people get rid of their cars? I kinda doubt it, because most people who own cars use them to get to work and basic shopping (groceries, etc.) due to living and working in different neighborhoods, or due to living in non-walkable areas.

We don't need to spend $11k a year to own, maintain, insure, and operate a car because we go to the mountains on weekends.

      "Hiking - We could have buses to popular trailheads from Denver and Idaho springs.  \n  \n* The lowest hanging fruit is Echo lake, there is easily enough demand for it - run a bus to echo lake, then turn the Mt Blue Sky road into bus shuttle-only. Not only would that protect the natural environment and animals by getting rid of all the traffic, pollution, and parked cars littered at summit lake and Mt Blue Sky peak, but it would allow you to enjoy the scenery more when you aren't focused on the road, and it would allow for one-way hikes that cover more ground than out-and-back. Imagine hiking from Echo Lake to Mt Blue Sky peak and then taking the shuttle down. Getting to Mt Blue Sky peak is honestly a let down when you are greeted by idling SUVs parked all over the place. Charge for parking at Echo Lake to help fund these shuttles.  \n* Berthoud pass could work too - it's a busy trailhead with access to hikes in multiple directions on the continental divide trail  \n* This is already a thing in some places. Back in 2019 we took Amtrak to Glenwood springs for a long weekend, on one day we hiked hanging lake via the required shuttle, and another day we took the RFTA bus to Maroon bells which also had a required shuttle, then did a great hike there. Zion national park had a good bus shuttle system that was very frequent, private cars were generally banned from the canyon - and I was SO glad they were otherwise you'd be listening to revved engines the entire time while you were trying to enjoy your hike.  \n  \nSkiing - We already have Snowstang buses that work great for skiing - I take these to Loveland every year! And we have the winter park express train, which is also great but pricier. Just need to expand Snowstang, push more people onto it, and I think more expensive/limited parking at the resorts would help create more demand for it then we'd have better service.  \n  \nFor everything else - it's not that complicated, just rent a car. Either with a car share service or standard rental. [Colorado car share](https://carshare.org/vehicles-locations/) has lots of availability around downtown, Cap Hill, and Boulder, and limited availability elsewhere including Longmont, Breckenridge, Dillon, Nederland.",
      "If they could figure out a way to do the last mile to a trail head.or camping area then this would work great. \n\nI Invision something like a reservation system that you could sign up for before hand that would see something similar to an access a ride grab you from say the Pine Junction park and ride and then take you to the trail head you signed up for."

I get my meds sent to Walgreens. If it‚Äôs in network based on your plan then they shouldn‚Äôt be giving you surprise billing.

Search for the 7000 E Hampden location for AdventHealth ER &amp; Urgent Care. My prior post included the URL, but AutoMod removed it due to having a shortened URL.\n\nI‚Äôve gone to the AfterOurs urgent care on Hampden multiple times. I‚Äôve only ever to pay my urgent care co-pay and, one time, a lab co-pay a couple of weeks after the visit. That was due to having a set of tests for COVID, flu, etc., which was reasonable to me. All of that is to say: try AfterOurs if there is one close to you?",

Whether I‚Äôve had a HDHP or a regular HP an urgent care visit is always far higher than visiting a PCP- 3 to 4 times higher seems to be the standard.",

The doc is being paid for their time, knowledge, availability for you, and taking up another patient‚Äôs time who needs to be seen.

Allow them to work for a year and re-evaluate their contributions.  Extend very temporary necessities (food, shelter, clothes, hygiene) for the first 2 weeks while they get their first paychecks.  Suddenly you will see the crisis correct as migrants will work/pay taxes and be required to contribute to society.  You will see less concentration of migrants in expensive cities like Denver as they will want to work in affordable areas.  Rural areas will become more populated and successful as laborers contribute.

      "The City of Aurora needs to address this issue. We need to collectively come together and do something. Our community is hurting. This isn‚Äôt normal. A 15 year old is dead because they were in a stolen car. Teens are stealing cars on a regular basis thanks to social media and don‚Äôt give a damn about themselves or the person they stealing from.  \n\nMy car was stolen from the parking lot of the high school I work at. I‚Äôm lucky my car recovered quickly,  and wasn‚Äôt responsible for killing someone or having someone be killed in my car. But this is getting to the point where this story could have been any of us. It keeps happening. \n\nIn my case, APD has been able to identify the teen who stole my car but the teen has not been arrested and is still stealing cars around the city. I can‚Äôt help but wonder is this the same kid? Or is it another teen who also keeps getting away with stealing cars. All for what‚Ä¶a joy ride?\n\nThese stories are heartbreaking. Our kids are hurting‚Ä¶ which only adds to them acting out, our laws are a joke when it comes to car theft. You shouldn't be able to continue to commit crime after crime and get away with it. This is becoming common place and kids don‚Äôt get in trouble and the behavior escalates.  The cops are a joke. These kids can‚Äôt think about the consequences of their actions beforehand. What are we teaching this teens?\n\nWe talk about wanting reform but we are setting our kids up for failure. We don‚Äôt even have a program to help better kids after committing a crime‚Ä¶.most of them are shuffled in and out of schools, are disengaged in school and allowed to roam the halls of school and are still up to same behavior. Teens naturally believe they are invincible‚Ä¶. We‚Äôve all believed that about ourselves at one time. Add that to getting away with crime after crime I can only imagine a teen feels more embolden. \n\n I‚Äôm all about rehabilitation and reforming the criminal justice system, but we need accountability, we need common sense laws, and we also need to help these kids better their lives so they won‚Äôt continue the same behavior. \n\nAnd who gets stuck with the responsibility? The car owner. Insurance doesn‚Äôt give a damn. So many of us are working so hard and barely making ends meet and you wake up and your car is gone and you can‚Äôt get to work! The person who had their car stolen not only has to deal with feeling violated but now to know a crime occurred in their car. I‚Äôm sure the car insurance company will try and pay out as little as possible.\n\nI am tired of seeing the suffering. Our systems are so broken. I don‚Äôt know what to do anymore. \n\nA child is dead. Parents, family, and friends are now mourning. A friend is responsible for killing their friend. Im sure the schools are now working on the response...and I wonder what the ripple effect will be in the school/community. I can only imagine between the 5 teens‚Ä¶this death is one of many. This event should have NEVER occurred in the first plane. \n\nMayor Mike, APD, APS, CCSD, City of Aurora Government officials, residents of the Aurora Community‚Ä¶.what are we going to do fix this problem? I love my city. I want the best for all of the residents, life is hard enough for everyone at the moment, but we need some accountability and we need to take action.",

      "Did you hire billybob and company at homedepot to do this work?  A General Contractor should be able to get to work on this without the customer asking questions on reddit.\n\nMy first suggestion would be to hit the line with a backhoe, mangle it good. But make sure you have all your locate requests done and make sure they are up to date, they expire after a few weeks.  You'll have no gas for a few weeks but you'll get bumped closer to the top of the list.\n\nStart the paper work trail tomorrow morning and let the misery begin.  It'll take 2-3 weeks to get the \"paper work\" processed.  After that you'll get assigned an engineer.  The engineer is over loaded with work so you will be about 6-12 weeks out before your new gas line is designed.  And yeah since this is spring they are getting loads of work dumped on them.  Once it is designed it will go out to either xcel or one of their contractors.  Once it is in their que it'll be an additional 2-12 weeks before someone comes on over and moves your line.  The fees add up and since it isn't an emergency or something they screwed up it'll be about 2-10k to move it for you.  Oh and the road cut if they decide to do that will be another 3-5k.  Maybe hiring a real contractor would have saved you all this shit.   \n\nJust my experience numerous times.  You may have better results.",

Worse, the leaves need to be wet so that the herbicide granules stick to the leaves - that's really hard to time in this arid environment. Even if you water first, in our low humidity things dry fast. \n\nSuch weed-n-feed mixes won't kill any weeds if applied this time of year. The fertilizer part is good, but the herbicide part may not help at all.\n\nLook for a pre-emergent mix. But really it is often best to just let the weeds sprout and then spray them. \n\n1: Fertilize and water and wait a few days after mowing before applying. That way the weeds have nice big leaves to absorb the herbicide and are metabolically active such that they'll move that herbicide down into the roots real fast like before the herbicide breaks down and becomes inactive. \n\n2: Don't mow for a few days after application. Don't water for at least a day after application. That allows the herbicide to be absorbed by the plant and gives it time to move throughout the plant, killing the whole things roots and all.",

He‚Äôd run into peoples garages at times even and they came out yelling at me. I shouldn‚Äôt have been In their open garage but I was just trying to get my damn dog. It was a game for him. Eventually he slipped his collar when my mom was walking him once and that was the last time anyone saw Kimbo. \n\nIt sort of has always made me feel bad having a dog who requires much activity and gives me this thought that I should have a dog like this. I live in a 650sqft apartment and would love to have the dog shown in this picture. Or almost any dog. I work a lot. I‚Äôm sure I could get out to dog parks when I can but I do feel bad when thinking about it.

The train to the airport is pretty cheap, and it may be much more cost effective to Uber/bus/ride to Union Station, rather than going all the way to the airport. And you can find covered parking downtown that's cheaper than the airport (though definitely not everywhere).\n\n3.

In the last two years, there‚Äôs been two or three shootings, of which the police have made no arrests, the stores didn‚Äôt close, nothing was done by security, no locked doors, NOTHING. People think the hailstorm and the recovery (or lack thereof) have led to it being more or less a ghost town, but what it really is, is just the denver areas shittiest mall. The people that consistently shop there are cheap, rude, and ugly. News flash, normal sensible people don‚Äôt wanna be around filthy smelly dude that are still sagging their pants and shoplifting at age 45. One of the Chinese massage parlors got busted for human trafficking in 2017-2018.

I see that there's a \"Clayton Community Days\" event happening on May 4, you might see if The Grow Haus is going and if they need any help at their table. (Metro Caring is another possibility.)",
